Wanda almost succumbs to her infection but is saved by the Clan of Cups! She makes a new friend and even finds the way
out of the dungeons but is dead set on helping her friend before she leaves. 

## Scene 1

Taking a dip in the waters had relieved me of the itch, but just as the scholar mentioned the vines where invigorated by
the water. I feel ill and weak. The vines seems to grow by the day and I have stopped bothering to remove them.

I have stared hearing voices. Its as if the vines on the walls of these halls are speaking to me. They guide me deeper
into the dungeons. Whispering that salvation is close. 

A lichen rook found me once more. I could hardly hold up my halberd at this point. Even so, I knew I would have to fight.
There was no escape. Then, a rock hits the Rook. Smashing its head in a single blow. The rest of the stone monster crumbled in
front of me. The last thing I remember was seeing a Mounted moving towards me...

## Scene 2

I woke up on a bed. The room was dimly lit with glowing crystals hanging from the ceiling. A white robbed figure with straight white
hair seemed to be mixing something at a table. She turned to me and seemed happy to find that I awoken. 

Lissette was her name. She was a kind and spiritual lady. She explained that she was the leader of the Clan of Cups. A group
of her followers found me on the outskirts of the city and brought me to her. She cured me of
the Rook Rot using a special Cup that turned water into a liquid that would burn away the vines growing on anyone that drank it.

She was soft spoken and did not use many words. When I thanked her for saving me, she simply smiled and kept mixing liquids in various
stone cups that she had around. She was an Armed who used her long and many joined stone arm to reach for the many cups in her chamber.
Pouring liquid from one cup to the next before pouring the result into glass jars. The water stored in these jars would glow different colors.

## Scene 3

I have found the city of Oubliette. Over the few days I spent in Lissette's care she explained that this was the primary city of the
Dungeons. The city was like an upside down castle. Towers hanged from the ceiling of the massive dome shaped Room the city was in. The tower
Lissette controlled was called the Gardens. The tower was 3 floors of lush greenery and peaceful dormitories. All of her followers wore white
robes and cared to the plants.

Bridges branched out for Lissette's tower to other towers where I could see all manner of people walking about. This city was larger than anything I
had encountered before. There was no telling what I would encounter if I was to walk around. 

Lissette explained that her clan's purpose was to help the people of Oubliette and all of the Dungeons. Their focus being on making this inhospitable
place livable. The Rook Rot that almost claimed me is an extremely infectious disease that is common here in the Dungeons. It is easy to cure, but it
can prove fatal for people that catch it and are unable to cure it or water it frequently. The plant feeds on the life force of the host. Slowly eating
away at it. The effects can be slowed with frequent dips in the water. Apparently the plant does grow in response to water, but stops feeding on the
host as much when it has water. The plant also grants the host strange Rot Magic. Allowing for the user to use other Lichen plants for defense and
attacks, like I had done in the green room I explored a few days ago. Some say that when the infection is particularly entrenched, hosts can even
speak to the plants around them.    

Lissette was kind enough to have one of her followers show me the most important areas of the city. Including the Clan of the Keys. This clan was lead by a
woman named Telenna. Apparently she was a legendary navigator and if I was looking for a way to reach the surface, she would be the one to ask. I also
was introduced to a kind old lady named Kouri. She was only a little taller than me and she was the leader of the Merchant's guild in this city. She was
assisted by her two daughters Kai and Kalia. Apparently she had many other daughters who ran their own shops in smaller settlements across the Dungeons and Roomlands. I also learned about Gorn and Monith. Leaders of the clan of Rings and Cult of Shards respectively.

## Scene 4

A way to the surface has been opened up to me. Telenna could help but my business in the dungeons was not complete. There is no way I
would leave without first helping Lissette! She insisted that her services where free, but I would not take no for an answer. Eventually,
she opened up and told me that there is something I could do for her.

Lissette said that she uses magical cups to create her healing elixirs. These cups are only found within the Labyrinths of the
dungeons. However, there is one type of cup that is exceptionally rare. The Goblet of Healing. This powerful artifact can be used
to turn water into a healing elixir that can heal any wound. Lissette has heard from her scouts that a nearby Labyrinth has this
treasure. Sadly the location is dangerous and none of her clan members are well suited for braving the depths.

I assured her that the goblet was as good as hers! Braving one of these Labyrinths was something I was hopping to do anyway. Being
able to help a friend would just be the cherry on top!
