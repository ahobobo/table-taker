With the kingdom saved from invasion the group has to take the fight to the enemy. 

## Plan of Attack

While the forces of Pitax and the Tigerlords have been repelled for now, the threat still
remains. The group needs to secure Fort Drev and take it away from Pitax.

Unfortunately, the fort is protected by guards and hill giants. Courtesy of Pitax. The group's
army is also battered and exhausted. Additionally, Kisandra, a daughter of one of Drelev's nobels
informed the group that she has a friend back in the keep who knows of a secret entrance to the
keep.

Deciding that their chances would be better if they dealt with this quietly, the group made the trek
to Fort Drelev alone.

## The Circus Comes to Town

On reaching the front gate, the group is immediately assailed by the guards. Some good deception rolls
convince them that the group is a traveling circus. Buying the lie, the group makes it into town without
much conflict. 

The group soon learns the location of their contact, Satinder. The group tells her their story and she agrees
to help.

## Black Pudding Battle

Satinder reveals that the castle has a secret emergency exit. She warns that the caves have been unused for
a very long time and she does not know what currently dwells within them.

The group enters and soon finds that they are not alone. In the first cave room, the group encounters a 
pair of Black Puddings. These slimy foes crawl out of a pool of water and begin to approach the group.

The battle was tough. Rox, Stetson and Gregile where almost dropped by the slimes. Thankfully, some powerful
blows from Smoke and Suzaku as well as healing from Stetson soon made quick work of the gooy monsters.

## Conclusion

With the puddings dealt with, the group is ready to enter the Keep proper. Their mission is to deal with Drelev.
However, they need to find him first. The keep is also heavly guarded. If the alarm is raised, the group risks
being overwhelmed. 

How things shake out will be documented in the next game!
