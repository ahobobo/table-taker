A very quick session this time! The group has successfully defeated the cult of the bloom
and the stolen lands where allowed a moment of piece.

Using the life energy of the caves that the cult was located in, the group was able to grow
themselves a new companion. The Wee Baby Fang is a baby dino that Rex had adopted way back when
the curse of the cult first started to rear its head. Exposure to the magics of the cave has
caused her to hatch and grow! She is now Rox's animal companion.

Additionally, the group took the chance to craft some new equipment. A shield for Rox and some
property runes for Rox and Smith. They are sure to see plenty of use in the coming sessions...

Unfortunately, the life of an adventurer in the Stolen lands is never peaceful for long. The group
had heard that Varnhold was having some troubles from some letters in the Cult's Cave. However, now
lady Aldory herself sent a letter to the group, requesting that they investigate.

Varnhold was completely empty when the group arrived. Aside for some rotting farm animals and the 
scavengers eating them. The group tried to cross a shallow river running through the town but was
ambushed by a pair of crab monsters. The group made quick work of these beasts and is now looking
to investigate the town proper...
