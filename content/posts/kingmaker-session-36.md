The group makes it to the whiterose abby! They go looking for a super weapon but find
more mundane but still helpful things instead.

## Giant Stomps Off

On the road to the Abby the group crosses paths with a giant grumbling under his breath.

The group saids they are tax collectors and ask about what the giant is doing.

The giant tells them that the Abby has some folks stationed there. He also instructs the group
to take the rat for everything hes got. 

The giant parts ways with the "tax collectors" and the group arrives at the Abby proper.

## Whiterose Abby

Abandoned and run down, the Abby seems quiet. The only signs of life being a sleeping guard at the top of a tower.

Smoke sneaks up the tower and delivers a massive crushing blow. The guard is hit through the wooden floor of the tower and lands in
a heap at the tower's base. 

Questioning the guard, they learn that the boss is inside the Abby and that no one really wants to be here.
It turns out the Abby is haunted and moral is very low. 

Stripping the guard, the group allows him to go free.

## The Rat

Hearing the commotion outside, the group hears a squeaky voice from the Abby calling out asking for whats happening.

The group answers back with promises of gold. Liking this, the voice asks them to enter.

Entering the abby the group encounters a few more guards and a rat kin. The rat introduces himself as Gastelli.
He is an acclaimed alchemist. Tasked by the king to create a horn that when blown would release an endless stream
of poison. There was just one problem, it is entirely impossible to create! Gastelli explains that he could not
get anything close to it. Only having a horn that worked like a decanter of endless water.

Gastelli explains that he was tasked with ambushing the group when they arrived, however he has been having a horrid time
here. The Abby's ghosts haunting him and his men every night. He is more than willing to change sides should the group
offer him payment.

The group does so. Gastelli is promised unlimited access to the towns brothels. He gives the group one final clue:
He believes that their is a water nimph trapped by the ghost somewhere. The king's palace is warded against all manner
of magics except fey magic. Should the group befriend this nimph, she might be able to grant the group a way to enter the king's
palace. 

## Crab for Diner

After their chat with the rat, the group heads to the winery, just east of the abby. The winery was said to be the main
haunt of the ghost. Before the group could get to deep in, they are assaulted by a pair of horrific crab monsters.

The monsters have a devastating ranged burst attack that significantly hurts the backline. Thankfully, Rox and Smoke
are more than capable fighters. Crushing the surprisingly weak shells of these creatures and ending the fight with hardly
a scratch.

## Conclusion

With the group's main goal in front of them, the party is ready for a spooky fight.

Will the group be able to rid the Abby of it's grizzly past? Can the water nimph be trusted?

All these questions and more will be answered, next time!
