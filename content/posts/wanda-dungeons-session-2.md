Wanda keeps exploring the Dungeons. Discovering an overflowing garden room and a way to alleviate the symptoms of her
Rook Rot. She also runs into a wondering scholar. The stranger is kind and gives Wanda some key insights into the
Dungeons.

## Scene 1

As I moved down the hall, I started hearing the sound of water. Moving to the source of this sound I entered a room
with a lake and a waterfall within. The lake was still aside for the small ripples that reached the shore line from
the waterfall. It seemed that the water was coming from a river in the Roomlands above. A massive crack in the ceiling
allowed some light to also come down into the room.

Before I could turn back to leave, I heard the familiar thud of a Rook's steps. Not wanting to be caught in the open, I ducked
for cover behind some rubble close to the shore. The light from the crack in the roof allowed me to get a look at the Rook that
had entered the room. Another Lichen Rook. This one was particularly overgrown with the stuff and it seemed like it could barely
move. The Rook was more plant than stone at this point. Vines clogging every cog and joint of the machine.

It shambled to the shoreline and then... Kept going. Walking straight into the lake and submerging itself in the water. It completely
submerged itself for a few moments. The only sign of it being the churn of the water as it moved around. I noticed some pieces of the
lichen also floating up from the Rooks location. A few minutes later and the Rook started to come back out again.

It seems that it had cleaned off some of the lichen while in the water. It still was mostly covered in the stuff but a lot of the 
overgrowth had been removed. I also noticed that some of the gears and joints that had been rendered mostly immobile where now moving
again. The water softening the vines and allowing for the machinery to function once more.

With its bath complete, the Rook shambled out of the room and returned to patrolling the hallways. 

Thinking the water might be a relief for my own condition, I decided to try taking a bath myself. The vines under my fur where exceptionally
itchy at this point and I was crazy for any sort of relief. Much to my delight, the water did the trick. I noticed that the lichen seemed to
get much softer when dipped in water. Making it easier to remove the stuff.

Feeling much better after my bath, I picked up my things and started heading down the hall once more. I was so happy that I did not notice
the Spectral Rook materialize behind me. The apparition had a massive crossbow on its head and it sent a bolt right at me. Unable to dodge I
took a direct hit. Just as before, the coward phased back into the walls as soon as I was able to get my bearings again. Never a dull moment
in the dungeons.

## Scene 2

As I went down the halls of the dungeon I found myself being drawn to a glowing room. The room did not have any cracks in the roof, the light
came from an incredibly dense amount of lichen in the room. The whole floor and walls of the room was covered in the stuff. The floor was not
stone brick like in all the other areas I had been in, but soft glowing grass. Fruit trees and bushes also dotted the floor. All faintly glowing.

Unfortunately I was not alone. A Rook spotted me and stomped after me. It made the lichen under my feet wrap around my legs, pinning me.
Then it launched a hardened spike of lichen at me. Unable to move I thought I was a goner, but to my surprise, I somehow was able to summon a wall
of harden lichen in front of me. Absorbing the attack. Using the opening, I cut myself free from the vines and moved in for the kill. The ruined stone
construct crumbling to a single blow from my halberd. 

While I was able to defeat the Rook, it seems that another that came before was not as lucky. I found the remains of another adventurer. His body
almost completely overtaken by the vegetation. All of his gear was ruined, but some gems and gold on his person remained intact. I paid my respects
and took the treasures. If I find a settlement I might be able to put these to good use.

## Scene 3

Once again I was caught by a spectral Rook. The ghost attacked as I was preparing to start my journey for the day.

I found another chained Rook. His remains where collapsing in on itself. Rubble forming along its hips. Searching the rubble, I was able to
find a few coins.

The real main event of the day was passing by a fellow adventurer. The man was friendly, tho he insisted that I keep my distance since I was
infected with Rook Rot. Apparently, that is the name of this strange lichen that keeps growing on me and everything else down here. The man asked
if I had encountered any labyrinths in my travels. I told him I did not know what those where and he was kind enough to explain that they where
the main reason that anyone would bother coming down her. Apparently, these massive structures held great treasures that could make a man
very rich. He himself was looking for one, tho he was not looking to make himself rich. He is a scholar and hopes to find some historical
texts within.

It was nice to have some company for once. He told me that if I was to find a settlement, the doctors could fix my Rook Rot problem. He
explained that while taking a dip in the dungeon waters would help alleviate the symptoms of the Rot, it would also hasten its spread.

We parted ways the next morning. He wished me luck on my journey and I did the same for him. While the day may have started rough, my run
in with this scholar has reinvigorated me. I am not alone down here and there are settlements out there. Maybe one of them has someone that
can tell me how to get back to the surface? Regardless, I have to keep moving.
