The lantern king's gauntlet continues! The group fights an old foe and makes a new friend. Or
Enemy? Friendemy? Lets begin!

## The Father

Climbing up to the second island, the group enters a dilapidated shack. Fetches stamp a table
asking for diner. The group joins them and plays along for now.

Then a massive fetch comes. looking like a messed up version of King Irovelly the fetch attacks the
group and the other little fetches join in. 

The battle goes on, Rox takes the majority of the punishment. The fetches landing lucky crits multiple times
on the resilient reptile. Thankfully, Stetson has heals and keeps Rox on his feet. Rox also does not take
their hits lightly. He stomps hard on the wooden floor, making a hole in the ground. Then begins using his
wrestling skills to throw fetch after fetch into the hole. Letting them fall into the abyss. 

## Trickery

After their fight in the cottage, the group exits to the island proper. They encounter what looks like a living
Vordakai arguing with lady Jamandi. Both beckon the group to come to them. The group decides to go to Vordakai's
side.

It turns out they choose right, some hidden fetches jump out of the thick brush on the island and start attacking
the group. The group is able to make quick work of them using their powerful ranged attacks and control spells.

Vordakai is clearly a fetch. Curiously, the lantern king thought it funny to have this fetch act as if Vordakai
was the group's good friend. He warns the group that the Lantern King's palace is on the last island. However, they would
also have to face their most powerful foe yet. A true Jaberwok.

## Conclusion

As the group climbs up to the last island, they get a glimpse of the palace. As well as a view of the monster
they have to get past before they can go to the lantern king.

How will the group deal with the Jaberwok? Will they regret not resting on the previous islands? Will the Lantern
King have any more tricks up his sleave? Find out... Next time! We are on the home stretch!
