The group takes on the palace treasury. Evades a trapped chest and is ready to take on king Irovelli.

## Treasure

The king stored his treasure in one of the castle basements. The room also doubled as a winery. Holding
some of the kingdom's most precious wines.

The group spots a chest. However, Rox is able to sense that not all is well. After some further examination,
the group discovers that it is armed with an alarm spell.

The group also hears some steps coming from the stars they came down. A pair of guards are on patrol. They
are dispatched by the group quickly, however one of the guards escape.

## Rematch

Calling for help, the previous guard summoned a old enemy. Juung, one of Irovelli's lieutenants comes back
for revenge.

He proves to be resilient, however he to falls after some big spells from Stetson and Suzaku.

## Conclusion

With Juung beat, the group licks their wounds in the king's thrown room... however, as they finish resting they hear
heavy footsteps approaching.

It seems the king tires of sending disappointing servants and wishes to take matters into his own hands...
