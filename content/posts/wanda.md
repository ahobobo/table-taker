A kobold with a magic relic that gives her freakish strength! 

She is the character I play as in solo games. She does not have a consistent story to her as she gets moved
between worlds and game systems frequently. Despite this, a few things always remain true for her.

1. She always has a choker with a red gem around her neck. This is her magic relic and is the source of her
strength. In any setting with magic (or tec so advanced as to be magic) it provides an excuse for her having
abilities in the first place. These abilities are not granted freely and come with the risk of losing control.
Especially in a fight.
2. She is nomadic. She does not stay in the same place for long since her gem and strange abilities attracts
the wrong kind of attention. She goes town to town working odd jobs for food and coin.
3. She is kindhearted but naive. She is not foolish enough to be parted with her gem for any reason (this
is sometimes due to the gem being magically attached to her) but is easy to deceive and trick.

Outside of these 3 constants, all else can be modified to fit the game / setting she is being put in.

In a solo Call of Cthulhu game, she became an investigator working for an agency looking into the occult. 

In a Colostle game, she was a Helmed with her gem being a special Rook core. 

In an urban / none combative setting her choker is her favorite article of clothing and she feels naked
without it.

Almost always tho, she fits into the warrior or berserker archetype. Her gem's power granting her strength at
the cost of making her see red in a fight.

## Appearance 

Wanda is tall for a kobold, always being 1/2 to 1 full foot taller than a regular kobold in the setting she is in. She is always
much smaller than a human.

She wears loose commoner clothing or even a simple loincloth and chest wrap to cover herself if the setting allows. She does not like
armor as it is uncomfortable and slows her down.

She might use a battle axe, dual axes or her claws as weapons. She does not favor ranged weapons.

## Personality

Wanda is friendly with a bubbly personality. She will usually have a smile on her face and will stop to talk with
anyone that approaches her. If a person is in need she will be happy to help them so long as they promise to feed
her for the night.

She is not the brightest. Going with her gut for most decisions instead of taking a look at the larger picture.

She is naive and tends to look for the good in people. Its easy to trick her.

In a fight, she gets serious. She becomes focused and determined to win. If things get dire, she taps into the gems power.
It grants her incredible strength and speed, but makes her reckless.
