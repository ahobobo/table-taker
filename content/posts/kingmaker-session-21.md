Big fights this time! The group clears out the rest of the Cradle of Lamantshu and gets rid of the cult of the bloom!

## Encounters of the Gnome Kind

After passing through a yellow mold infested room, the group started hearing some sad humming.

Investigating further, the group caught a glimpse of the source of this humming. He glowed faintly and
then passed through a suspiciously smooth stone wall. Rox smashed his way through, revealing that the wall
was not natural and was infact placed there by a shape stone spell

The ghost explained that his name was Jin and he was a druid that had entered this cave long ago in hopes
of bringing nature back to balance. Unfortunately, another druid named Darvan was with him. Darvan had other
plans for the power emanating from this cave. He killed Jin and started the cult of the bloom.

## Killing Darvan

Promising to restore balance and deliver justice, Jin faded into the afterlife. The group made good on
their promise. Turning back around and encountering Darvan in his section of the cave. The fight was not
to long. Darvan got good hits in but did not have a lot of health. 

For their troubles, the group was able to take a special sword and a magical tent that Darvan used as his
room in the cave.

They also found that Darvan was about to send a letter to someone called Vordakai. He was hopping to ally
himself with this person.

Hiru also took a special book. Titled "Summoning Spells for the Special", the book seemed to have information
and rituals for carrying out powerful summoning. They might even be used to help in bringing about a demon.

## Lamanshu's Portal

The cult had a pet Manticore that they where growing and planning to use as the portal to summon Lamanshu. This
beast was absorbing and growing stronger from the rift that was in this cave. In order to stop the curse, the group
would have to kill the beast. Thus closing the rift and stopping the cult once and for all.

The fight with the manticore proved much harder than with Darvan. The group was low on resources at this point. however,
they where able to down the beast... And then it happened! 

On death, the manticore exploded in a burst of life magic. The group was healed some of the damage they had taken in the
fight, however, they also noticed that something had grown out of the creature's corpse. A giant flower! The bloom of
Lamanshu was able to make it into the world. The flower was dazed in the process, unable to act for this first round.

The group worked swiftly. Realizing the plant would be weak to slashing damage. They got to cutting and where able to
burst the plant down before it could unleash a counter assault. 

## Conclusion

With the cult vanquished, the group salvaged some parts from him. A centipede carapace, for the creation of a shield.
A snake venom sack, for the creation of a corrosive weapon rune and a snake rattle to strike fear into their foes.

While the cult has been stopped, the group has already learned about some strange happenings. Specifically in Varnhold.
What foes will the group have to face this time? We will find out in the next session!
