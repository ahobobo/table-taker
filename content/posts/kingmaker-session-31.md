After a long hiatus, the group is back in the Stolen Lands!

This session, the group travels to the Tigerlord's camp where they are excavating the Tomb
of Armag. The current leader of the Tigerlord's is said to be looking for a powerful
artifact buried deep within.

## Tigerlord Takeout

The first order of business the group engaged in is fighting a small army! A group of 12
Tigerlords have set up camp outside the Tomb while their leader plunders the the inside of
it.

The group gets to work right away, the Tigerlords are tough and come in great numbers but
they are no match for the group. Some key moments in the fight include Stetson casting
Chain Lighting and halfing the hp of 6 of them. Suzaku casting Dominate on a Tigerlord and
getting him to bear hug his friend. Effectively taking 2 barbarians out of the fight. There
was also Smoke casting Blazing Dive. A very flashy engage spell where he slammed into 6
Tigerlords, coming down as a blazing flash of light.

## Saving the Nobles

The Tigerlords where keeping the Nobles of Fort Drelve. They where unharmed currently, but
once Armag got his artifact, he planned to kill them off.

Grateful for being rescued the group divulged that Armag, was not in fact Armag. No one
knows his true name, but he is not the true reborn great warrior of legend. However, the
artifact stored in the tomb would allow him to become the true warrior of legend.

The Legendary cursed Sword Ovinrbaane (Enemy of all Enemies). This blade contains the soul 
of the great Armag himself. Any who weld this blade will, over time, be possessed by 
him and eventually transform into him.

## Conclusion

We ended with the group entering the tomb to confront Armag. The group has learned that the
tomb is filled with traps. The Iron Wraiths where captured and forced to go into the tomb
with Armag to serve as his 'trap finders'. 

Next time! the group enters the tomb and seeks to stop Armag.
