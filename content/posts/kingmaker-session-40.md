King Irovelli fries! The time for talk is over. King Irovelli confronts the group. Seeking to
take them out once and for all. He puts on a good fight but the group beats him.

## The King's Arrival

After licking their wounds from the fight with Juung. The party hears slow clapping approaching them
down the hall.

The king strides in with his Naga Consort. He offers the group diplomacy. Saying they could rule the stolen
lands together. Possibly even expand their kingdoms out of the stolen lands.

The group is not having it. Immediately starting combat.

## Necklace of Fireballs

Remembering a treasure from the tomb of Armag. Rox pulls out a necklace of fireballs the group got. Normally,
a user would throw beads one at a time. Rox opts to throw the entire thing at the king and his Naga! Rolling 
over 70 D6s, this attack will likely be the most dice rolled in a single attack for the entire campaign.

The king is able to doge out of the way, his Naga is less fortunate. She takes over half of her health bar.

## Naga Bites Back

Seeing that Rox is not going to be affected by her poison, the Naga charges at Stetson. She gets a crit on the
poor fairy and inflicts him with her poison. It clouds his mind, making spells harder to cast.

Thankfully, she also gets zapped. "BAD TOUCH!" yells the fairy as he gets a free Tempest Surge on the snake.

## The King's Last Charge

Seeing that he needs to make some distance between him and Rox, the king attempts to dive the group's back line.
He brings Suzaku low, but does not take her out. He also takes 2 solid swings from Rox and Smoke.

## Conclusion

After taking a pummeling from Smoke and Rox, the king was on his last legs. Suzaku casts Void Warp attempting to
finish off the wounded king. He fails the save and is defeated.

With Pitax liberated, the group is able to take control of Pitax. Absorbing it into their own kingdom.

The group is also level 15. granting them powerful new spells and abilities. These will no doubt prove to be useful
in the coming days as the group begins to learn about the strange happenings at Candlemire.....
