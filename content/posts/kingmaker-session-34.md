Armag is defeated! The group has an intense battle with Armag and emerges victorious.
The defeat of the Tiger Lords brings with it a surrender from the Pitax kingdom. As well
as an invitation to something called the Rushlight Tournament.

## Preparing for Armag

Asking Zorek about who went into the tomb with Armag, the group learned that he has 4 other
warriors with him.

The group uses this information to prepare appropriate spells and abilities before they
knock down the door...

## The Battle

The group finds a quivering man staring into a sword that he wields in his hands. The bodies of
the solders that entered the tomb with him surround him.

"I-I am Armag..." he whispers, then his face changes to one of pure anger and hatred.

"I AM ARMAG! I WILL BRING DOWN THE KINGDOM OF GLOOMWERTH AND CONQUER THESE LANDS ONCE AGAIN!".

Armag wastes no time going in for the fight. He goes for Rox, seeing him as the strongest warrior
of the group. He shows his marshal might, hitting rox despite rolling low. The group notices the
threat and responds in kind.

Gregile and Suzaku cast powerful debuffs on Armag. Significantly weakening him. Stetson also tries to
chunk him, unleashing the powerful Chain Lightning spell. Unfortunately, despite being in a greatly
weakended state, Armag rolls a nat 20 on his save. Completely negating Stetson's spell.

Despite this rough start, The group is able to land solid blows on Armag. Slowly bringing him down.

The group lands the final blow on Armag... But he does not go down! Armag is reanimated by the power of
Orvinbane! He is confused and swinging madly but could still cause serious damage if the group does not
remove Orvinbane from him quickly!

Thankfully, the group has Rox and Rox has the support of Hiru, Gregile and Stetson. by pooling their resources
Rox is able to successfully force Orvinbane out of Armag's grasp. A decisive and hard strike from Smoke's hammer
then bring an end to Armag for good.

## Conclusion

their first line of defense defeated, Pitax surrenders and as a show of good will, invites the party to something
called the Rushlight Tournament.
