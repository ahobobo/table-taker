After a good few months of downtime, the group starts to hear rumblings from their people
that not all is well at Candlemire. The Willo Wisps have grown in number and all who get to close
feel a great unease. Wanting to appease their people, the group decides its time to return.

The group enter's the mysterious Candlemire tomb. They encounter undead Pharasmins who have been
in a timeless conflict with a Cult of Yog Sothoth. After some persuasion, the group is able
to prove that they want to help.

## Enter The Tomb

Candlemire has always been a strange place. Willo Wisps constantly floating. A feeling of dread
hanging heavy in the air. Previously, the group had encountered a powerful magic seal. They were
talked out of interfering with it by a friendly wisp. The magic of the seal was also beyond them
at the time.

Now, Stetson, Suzaku, Smoke and Gregile have grown into powerful mages. They gather together in a magic
circle and break the seal. Granting passage to the temple below.

## The Pharasmins

Going down a winding staircase, Gregile is able to identify that the cave is depicting the last story
of the Pharasmins. It tells of  brothers fighting a great evil together.

Finally reaching a room, the group encounters 4 grave knights with holy symbols of pharasma.

They are surprised and shocked the group came down here. They ask for the group to come with
them to speak with their leader.

## Talking with Korog

Korog is the hero of the ancient story of the Pharasmins. He is was sealed in here with his
traitorous brother. Forsaking their bond with Pharasma, they turned themselves into grave knights
to protect this tomb.

He is distrusting of the group at first. Its clear his pride causes him to turn away help. However
he eventually does give in. He asks the group to take out a Shogoth to the south. Him and his troops
would take the cultists to the west.

## Conclusion

After some epic battles with small groups of cultists the group makes it to the Shogoth's chamber...
They will take on this great beast... Next time!
