A short session today! The group is invited to a hunting competition and learns about some strange magic that is beginning
to influence the wilds around their kingdom.

## News From NocNoc

NocNoc, the goblin starts the session off with news about his latest exploits. As it turns out, a goblin with a pension
for killing can put his talents to good by working for the Embeth Travelers. 

This famous hunter's guild is well known in Brevoy and Restove. They are a large organization of big game hunters who have
set up a camp in the stolen lands.

NocNoc explains that the group has come to hunt the unusual creatures of the stolen lands that have started to pop up all
of a sudden. The group is also going to be making a sport out of it. NocNoc explains that they have camped next to a particularly
infested area with a very large concentration of monsters. The group has been invited to a feast for the rules of the competition
to be told to them.

## Travel to The Lodge

Something strange is a foot. As a result of the increased monster frequency, the group has twice the chance of running
into a beast on their travels.

Due to this increased chance, the group actually runs into 3 encounters on their way to the Embeth Travelers.

A duo of giant spiders, a house cat turned monster and a group of carnivorous plants where all found along the way.
These monsters where not to tough but their appearance was strange. They are all out of place here in what is normally
a peaceful plains. Additionally, they all let loose a bunch of tiny black seeds on their deaths. 

Smith had read about this in a book once! He was able to identify the seeds as being infused with the Magic of the First
World. Some fey influence had corrupted the lands and creatures and was causing these creatures to appear.

Additionally, the group noticed strange outcroppings of greenery in the plains where greenery would normally not be
found. Even the grass under their feet seemed longer and wilder than normal.

## Jamel Visser, Leader of the Embeth Travelers

With the ordeal of getting to the Lodge behind them, the group finally gets to meet Jamel.

Jamel is a gruff tall man. Scars from countless battles cover his body. He is joined with a team of
other Embeth Travelers as well as two other groups.

Annamede Belavarah is a snarky human bard from Pitax. She is joined by 2 guards who protect her.

Edina and Jolia Aldori are sisters from Restov and they seek to increase their reputation by winning
this hunting competition. Edina is eager to fight no matter the odds. Jolia is more conservative in
her approach and often to try and hold her sister back.

## Conclusion

With the group at the Lodge, next session is set up to be a good one. What is with the beasts that have
started to pop up all over the place? Is the fey queen making another move? Are the goblins of Greengripe
to blame?

All these questions and more will be answered ... Next time!
