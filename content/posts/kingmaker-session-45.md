The group destroys the focusing lense! Putting an end to the cult of Yog'Sothoth
once and for all.

## Confronting Foralas

The group finds the cult leader in a strange circular room. Half of the room transformed into
a magical observatory. Foralas and his followers meditating in the center.

He Begins by casting time stop and setting up a bunch of nasty spells. They have no effect on
this turn but they will start causing damage in later rounds.

Thankfully the group has a bunch of nasty spells of their own. The nastiest being a spell
from Suzaku. A dark cloud surrounds the room. Causing damage to all the cultists for the rest of
combat. It also comes with the added benefit of giving them all a chance to miss their attacks!

Other notable events include a massive wirlwind strike from Rox, causing massive damage to all
the cultists. A big spell strike from Smoke, Chunking Foralas for almost 3 quarters of his health in a single blow.
And an epic finisher from
Gregile who sent a sacrificial dagger that was on a table right between Foralas' eyes. 

## Cleansing the Caves

With Foralas dead, the group finds their prize. A stone tablet with a gate inscription. The tool they
needed to perform the ritual to stop the focusing lense and ensure that Yog'Sothoth does not end up
coming to Golarian. Coming into a ritual circle all the casters of the group chant. Dark smoke comes off
the cave walls and gets sucked into the gate icon. After a time the smoke stops coming and for the first
time since the group entered this cursed place, they feel at peace. 

## Conclusion

With the caves dealt with, the group goes home. As they rest they are visited by a vision of Phrasma herself.
They are blessed by her. They would no longer feel the ill effects of age. Additionally they would deal bonus
damage to undead targets. The group gets time to recoup from their adventure. Creating magnificent new gear to
increase their power.

However all is not well in Gloomsworth. Rox is awoken by his daughter one night. She was frightened by a nightmare.
She saw the entire kingdom consumed by strangling vines that choked the life out of everyone. The next morning,
the group hears of a disturbance in the woods...
