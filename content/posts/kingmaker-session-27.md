After a few months of peace, the kingdom of Gloomworth is assaulted by a new danger!

## War Comes for Gloomworth

To the west, the kingdom of Pitax and the Tiger Lords have long been at each other's throats.
However, the situation has changed. Pitax and the Tiger Lords have entered an uneasy alliance.
The reason? They both fear the expansion of Gloomworth. Word has spread quickly of the kingdom's
strength and both parties have decided that something needs to be done about it.

Also in the mix is the kingdom of the Iron Wraiths, Fort Drelev. Drelev's charter gave him land
that proved to be less than ideal. They where in close proximity to the swamp. Meaning they had
trouble building up. On top of that, they also where under constant assault from the Tiger Lords.
With Pitax now also knocking on their door, Drelev surrendered and entered the alliance.

As a show of loyalty, Drelev gave his nobles to the Tiger Lords to keep as prisoners. One of these
nobles refused to go along with his plan. He and his family where imprisoned. Thankfully, his
youngest daughter was able to escape capture and headed to Gloomworth to warn them of Drelev's
plans.

As part of his surrender Drelev promised to assault Gloomworth and capture a beachhead in the
fey forest. From there, the other armies could gather and a true assault on Gloomworth could be
done.

## The Battle for Tatzleford

Tatzleford currently had a small fort serving as Gloomworth's lumbering operation. Unfortunately,
this was also the target of Drelev's army.

The nobel's daughter warned the group about the coming threat. From their the group mustered their
own army to meet them. However, the kingdom's general, Rox, was strangely absent.

Gloomworth's army was clearly outnumbered and outmatched. Even with minimal strategy, Drelev's army 
would win due to numbers alone. Thankfully, the group was not just idly watching the fight. They got
in the thick of things and took out a detachment of humans and a troll.

Unfortunately, the group found themselves surrounded. They where outmatched and it looked like they
where going to have to go out fighting. But then, Rox appeared! He was joined by a tribe of other
lizard folk riding raptures and triceratops. They ravaged the enemy and turned the tide of the battle.

## Chopping Off The Head

The opening made by the lizard folk revealed the commander of the enemy. He stood tall and proud. Accompanied 
by a troll body guard. He called out to the rulers of Gloomworth and challenged them to a fight.

The group was happy to do so. The fight started with the troll body guard charging into the group. Almost one
shotting Gregile and Stetson. Rox charged in the other direction. Going straight for the commander.
The group was able to recover and killed the troll after a few good spells and the liberal use
of fire spells.

The commander proved to be much more resistant. He sported full chain mail and was quick on his feet.
The group struggled to get good hits on him. On top of that, his dual sword attacks proved to be
powerful. Cutting Rox and Smoke with a floury of strikes.

However, he did eventually fall. With their leader killed, the army was soon routed. The battle
for Tatzleford was won.

## Conclusion

With the army defeated, it was time to take the fight to the enemy. The group set their sights on
heading to Fort Drelev. The group does have one friend in there. He is currently trapped in the
prison. Will the group save him? I suppose we will find out next time!
