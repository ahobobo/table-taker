This ep is going to be the last adventure using the colostle system, At least for now! Wanda will be adventuring on the surface or somewhere else.
Still diving down into the debts of the colostle while also exploring the Roomlands. 

In this ep, Wanda dives into a massive labyrinth to get the Goblet of Healing for Lisset. After getting this for her, Wanda will be free to return to
the surface by asking the great Mounted Telenna for help.

## Getting to the Site

The journey to the Labyrinth was a long one. Thankfully, Grale, a mounted in service to Lisset was happy to take me to the entrance. He explained that
all who had entered this labyrinth have not come out. A party of 2 explorers had entered a few days back and still had not come out. He hoped that they
where ok, but this was the last day that he was going to be coming over here to see if they had made their way out.

"I fear the labyrinth has consumed them" he said.

The entrance to this area was a 30 foot arch. It looked similar to an entrance to a small room, however, the arch was so overgrown that the stone making
up the arch was completely hidden. Not a single stone was clean of moss or vegetation.
