The group takes on 4 alien creatures guarding a garden. They are interrupted by an
unexpected guest. 

## The Mastiffs  

Entering the cult's garden cave, the group runs into 4 all black centaur like creatures.
They have hard exoskeletons and large bulbous heads. They also have long sharp teeth. The
group is able to spot the creatures hiding in the bushes before they get the jump on them.

## Darkness and Wind Strikes

The creatures prove to be resilient. Their hard skin being highly resistant to most of the
group's attacks. However, a spirit blast from Gregile, a new powerful darkness spell from
Suzaku and a series of powerful wind strikes from Stetson eventually take 2 of the creatures
down. 

## The Dream Stalker's Demand

After taking out 2 of the beasts, the group sees the other 2 implode on themselves...

A wispery voice echoing off the walls saids "I believe... we could help each other...".

The group turns to see an Envoy of Leng standing on the stairs they came down. Empty eyes
staring at them without the slightest hint of emotion.

## Conclusion

What does the Envoy want? What treasure is in the cultist's garden? These questions and more will
be discovered... next time!
