The group takes on a powerful black dragon, learns the power
of forgiveness and begins uncovering the secrets of Nyrissia's
castle... And the secrets of Nyrissia herself?

## The Dragon's Demand

After the colapse of Nyrissia's realm, the group was able to finally
reach her castle. The House at the Edge of time. However, before they could
enter, they would need to defeat a Black Dragon guarding the entrance.

She demanded the the group stop. Saying that she knew they where actually 
working for the Lantern King! The group clarified that they where certainly not.
The dragon explained that the idea came to her since Nyrissia was very close to
completeing the Apology. That is, filling a magical atifact with kingdoms from
countless worlds. 

Nyrissia had gotten 999 out of 1000 kingdoms. Gloomwerth was to be the last one.
It seemed to convinient to the dragon that the last kingdom would put up this
much trouble for Nyrissia. Logically, it must be the Lantern King playing a
trick.

Once again the group explained that they where acting of their own behaf. The dragon
believe them this time. Even so, there was no way that she would allow them to hurt
Nyrissia. She explained that she owed much to her. Seeing no other option, the group
was thrust into combat.

The fight was a great team effort. A spell from Gregile made the Dragon fall to the ground.
Opening up the chance for Rox to grab her. Stopping her from going back into the air. Tempest
Surges from Stetson proved effective and devistating spell strikes from Smoke where enough
to seal her fate.

With the last of her life leaving her, the dragon begged the group to "forgive Nyrissia".
Exactly what this means was still not clear to the party.

## The House at the Edge of Time

The castle overlooked a lake with water that seemed to fall endlessly into an abyse. Mountains
formed and withered to dust in seconds far away.

The group expirianced the first lost memory of Nyrissia's past as they entered. Nyrissia dancing
under the moonlight. Swooning over her love for Count Ranalc.

Next they faced some phantasmal guards. They where hostile but lighened up when they saw Stetson
offering them some conversion. The guards explained that they had done some terrible things in
service of Nyrissia, but they where sorry about them. They where desprite for forgiveness.

Stetson gave it to them, and.... They faded away! It seems that some members of Nyrissia's followers
still had some goodness in their hearts. A show of forgiveness might be all that is needed to
make them repent.

## Demiplain Within

The group then encounted a tree with a great magical aura. Smoke was able to identify this as
the entrance to another demiplain with this demiplain. He also expirianced another memory. Nyrissia
declaring herself and another large group of fey free from "his" tyranany. She declared that her
Love would make her an Eldest and that they would no longer be under "his" rule.

The group decided not to enter the plain. Instead deciding to explore some of the castle. THey activated
two traps in the process and fought off some fey crow monsters in the process.

## Conclusion

Nyrissia is near. Somewhere, high up in the castle, she awaits the group. 

What other secrets will the group learn as they venture up the castle? What other monsters and tricks
does Nyrissia have in store for them? All these answers and more will be had... Next time !
