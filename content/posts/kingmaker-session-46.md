The group defend's their kingdom from Nyrissia's assault ! Saving their citizens and
trying to figure out what is going on.

## Fey Morning

After some time of peace, the rulers of Gloomwerth wake up to a horrible commotion.

Their kingdom is under assault to the south and to the east. The docks of the kingdom are
flooded. Putting the lives of their citizens in danger. At the same time, the kingdom's farms
to the east have been attacked by a swarm of small creatures. Taking many children away from
their families.

The group saves the kids first. They had been abducted by a swarm of childish mandrakes.

With some clever performances by Steson and Rox, Suzaku is able to sneak past the nasty
little creatures. She uses her powerful magics to free the children that had been buried to
their necks in the fields.

Next the group goes to the Docks. They find the lake has risen and water is up to their knees.
The cause? 2 large water elementals. They try to fight the group but quickly regret their choice
as the group is able to dispatch them fairly easy.

## The Horned Hunter

With the elementals taken care of the group gets a moment of respite. However, it does not last long as
they hear a commotion coming from the north in the heart of Gloomwerth!

A giant tree has sprung in the middle of the capital. On top of that a tall horned man with the legs of
a goat taunts the group. He is trailed by 2 trolls who are smashing buildings as he calls for the group
to fight him

The fight starts out a little rough. Rox is affected by a powerful fear spell. Leaving the group exposed to
the trolls. Thinking quick, Smoke takes a gamble and tries to take out the Horned Hunter. He moves in... and
rolls a nat 20!

The crit spellstrike + disintegrate combo deals over 200 dmg to the Hunter in a single strike... Reducing him
to ashes. With their leader gone, the trolls are dispatched shortly after.


## The Jabberwocky 

The town is safe... For now. However all the creatures the group fought had warned the group that this was not
the end. Later in town the group learns that Nyrissia is looking to invade their kingdom and that she has
a Jabberwocky under her control. 

What will be Nyrissia's next move? How can she be stopped? Find out... Next time !
