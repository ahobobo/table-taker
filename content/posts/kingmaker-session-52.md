The group explores deeper into Nyrissia's castle. Discovering more about her past
and taking on her closest subjects.

## The Advisor's Trick

The group enter's the thrown room. It at first appears empty until an
angel appears! The angel pleads that the group repents and leave the castle
lest they anger their gods.

Little did the trickster know, smoke has true site. He immediately see's through
the creature's trick. A fight breaks out soon after.

The Worm that Walks gets some damage on the group, but it quickly falls thanks to a
series of hits from Rox.

## Vision's of the Past

While the group keeps exploring, they come across more visions from the past.

They see Nyrissia defeating a Jabberwocky. One of her Nymph sister's saying that this would
not be the last assault from the Lantern King.

They also witness Nyrissia facing a fey army. The group sees that many of the monsters in this
army are creatures that they had fought before. Nyrissia stands before them and declares that they
should join her instead of fight her. She promises to protect them from The Lantern King.
The creatures drop their weapons and come to her side.

## Forgiving the Nymphs

On the second floor, the group encounters Nymphs that had their eyes plucked out. They explain
their eyes where taken as part of Nyrissia's punishment. 

King Gregile uses his amazing diplomacy to calm and assure the Nymphs. He pleads for them
to forgive themselves and assures them that they will do the same for Nyrissia.

With their souls free of guilt, they vanish. Thanking the group and reminding them to keep
holding forgiveness in their hearts.

## Conclusion

After dealing with the Nymphs, the group find's themselves in Nyrissia's bedroom. They
discover the love letters she sent to Count Ranalc. They also discover an entrance to yet
another pocket plain.

Feeling that the end of this adventure is close, the group rests up. Regaining their strength
before entering this pocket plain in Nyrissia's room...
