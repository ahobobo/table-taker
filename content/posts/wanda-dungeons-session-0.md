Howdy! Something a little different for those who like to read, a solo rpg adventure, staring none other
than [Wanda](/table-taker/posts/wanda). I have never published these adventures before but think it could
be cool to do so. For those that don't know how something like this works, its a little like writing a journal.
I will use the rules of the Colostle system to see what happens to Wanda and write out the results. 

I will also try to summarize the sessions for easier reading. 

## The System

As stated, I will be using the simple [Colostle](https://www.colostle.com/) system. It is a popular journaling rpg with
one of my favorite fantasy settings. Additionally, I will be using the Dungeons expansion for the game. The expansion adds
a few new systems and new locations to explore as well as some new lore to the world.

## Wanda's Motivation

Long ago, I played a few sessions as Wanda with the base game. She traveled across several rooms of the Colostle. Fought bandits that
where stealing from villages and felled many Rooks in her journeys. One day, she was abducted by gargoyles and taken to the
rafters. From there, she found a passage to reach the Roof of the Colostle.

Shortly after, Wanda was able to defeat an Astral Rook and became a Within. Piloting the mighty rook for a while.

I stopped playing after that, but I want to pick up where she left off while also starting fresh. 

After exploring the rooftops in her Astral Rook for a time, Wanda has discovered that it is running out of energy.
Realizing that she might not be able to return to the ground floor safely without the Rook's help, she decides to use
the last of its power to fly back to the Colostle's floor level. Attempting to land in what looked like a small dark
room.

Except it was not the Colostle's floor at all! Unable to control the Rook, Wanda found herself falling down a massive hole in
the ground. Passing the threshold Wanda is able to see that she has fallen into a massive dark chamber. Not at all like the ground
room floors she was hoping to get back to. By this time, she could not pull the Rook back. Falling deeper and deeper into the hole
till she finally crash lands on a hard stony floor.

Waking up in the wreck of the Astral Rook, Wanda hopes to find a way out of this strange land...
