The final battle for Fort Drelve! The group confronts Drelve and passes judgement on him. They also learn
the current location of the leader of the Tigerlords. The group deals with an uppety wizard. Fort Drelve is
put under new management. Suzaku is also soon to be a mother. 

This session also marks a very special achievement for me and my group, we have successfully played to 12th
level in PF2e! This is the highest level I have ever GMed for and also the longest running campaign I have
ever been able to play in. A huge thanks to my lovely players for sticking with me this far! Just 8 more levels
to 20 folks!

## Stroon

Going up the stairs to the second level of the castle, the party bumps into a strange looking wizard with an
imp familiar.

Identifying himself as Stroon, he ushers the group into his study.

After some formalities, he implores the group to kill Drelve for him. Drelve has been cheating on his sister, and
he has been plotting to kill him. However, he wants to remain a nobel after the deed is done.

The group agrees to handle Drelve for him.

## Drelve

Drelve is held up in his thrown room with guards. He implores his guards to save themselves, however, they stand
by their king. 

Moved by the show of loyalty and an admiration of the Iron Wraiths. Rox, Stetson and Suzaku implore Drelve to stand
down. They promise him a fair trial and the safe transfer of power if he where to do so.

After some very good diplomacy checks (2 crits!!) Drelve agrees. He orders his men to stand down and puts away his
blade. The leader of the Iron Wraiths willingly goes into custody.

However, there is another matter. He wishes for his mistress to not be harmed. Quintessa is a nobel from outside the
stolen lands. Far to the north. She came down looking for fortune and found it in Drelve's arms. She is no slouch and
is an accomplished bard but she prefers to not get into a fight.

The group promises the safe deportation of Quintessa. 

## Are We the Baddies?

Going back down to the base of the castle, the group sees Stroon and his sister Paretta. More importantly he sees them
with a very alive Drelve! 

Angered, he asks the group what the meaning of this is. He implores the group's Magus, Smoke for an explanation.

"I gave you my Scrying Spell!" Stoon exclaims.

For his part, Smoke answers in a way befitting an adventurer such as himself:

"lol."

Rox approaches the wizard and saids that he is under arrest and that an investigation and trial must be done.

Obviously unhappy with the matter, the wizard attacks the group. A short battle ensues with Suzaku *almost* tasting
the ground after being nearly one shot by a powerful chain lightning spell. Almost poetically, Suzaku is the one
to get the last hit on Stroon, using a powerful curse to stop his heart. 

## Conclusions

Drelve is judged and his life is spared. He is currently living out the rest of his days as a commoner. He is happy with
his new lot in life. 

Fort Drelve has been put under the management of Strevika. The informant that helped the group infiltrate the castle in the
first place. 

Armang's Tomb has been marked as the next point of interest for the group. This is where the leader of the Tiger Lords is
currently. He is supposedly searching for a powerful relic of his people that is sealed in this tomb. It is also the last
known location of the Iron Wraiths.

Suzaku is with a child. Jinchi has also gone missing. She assures the group that all is well and they need not worry...

After nights of study, Smoke is able to successfully craft a Soul Cage and transforms himself into a Lich.
