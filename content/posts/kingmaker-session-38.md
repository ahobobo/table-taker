The group is pushed to their limits with some big fights. The group encounters a "friend" within
the castle and Rox, after learning about his families' location many many sessions ago, finally
saves them.

## Throwing Down in the Thrown Room

After being transported to the castle by the nimph, the group steps into the thrown room.

It was empty but not for long. While the group was examining the king's chair, his lieutenants
enter.

The group tries to lie, however they are not as lucky as they where last time.

The battle strains the group's resources however, a powerful spell from Suzaku causes an
Oni warrior to flee. While Rox is able to cut down a human barbarian.

Mid fight, a Tiger Lady attacks the group. She does her best to avoid direct confrontation.

After the other 2 where defeated she surrendered.

## A Tough Choice

She confesses that she is just a mercenary. More loyal to the king's gold than to the king
himself. She gives the group 2 vital pieces of info.

1. The location of the king's Panic Room.
2. The location of a pair of lizard folk who are about to be executed.

Rox and the rest of the group are able to put 2 and 2 together. The Lizard folk that where captured are
likely to be Rox's family. With this realization, the group accepts the risk of tipping off the king and
having a harder time getting to him. The lives of Rox's family comes first.

## Saving Sada and Lilu

Going down a set of stairs, the group enter's the palace dungeon. They hear the screams of 2 women and the
sick laughter of a demented man. 

The group find the pair of lizard women strapped to torture devices. They are worst for wears and would likely
have died if the group did not arrive when they did. Working fast, Rox and the rest fight the gargoyle jailer and Gregile
works to release the women from their shackles.

## The King's Entrance

After the women are freed, the group hears footsteps coming from the stairs...

King Iorveli himself and a small detachment of guards come. The king stays back and buffs his troops while his guards enter
the fray.

The battle is fierce. Smoke in particular takes a beating from the Gargoyle and other guards. However, Stetson is able to heal him
Rox charges directly to the king. Tanking the assault from his guards.

After some good blows, King Iorveli sees that the situation is deteriorating. Taking out a wand from his cloak, he casts
Dimension Door. Disappearing from the fight.

## Conclusion

After cleaning up the rest of the guards, the group tends to their own wounds and the wounds of Rox's Family.

The group goes back to the fountain and teleports back to the Whiterose Abby.

A heartfelt conversation with his family ensues. Sada gets to feel the love of her husband once more and Lilu gets
to meet her father for the first time.

The family is also able to divulge the layout of the castle for the group. Detailing potential dangers they might have to
face. The group's ears perk up after learning about the palace treasury. They resolve to raid it.

With their next goal set, the group rests at the Abby to recover their spells.

In the next session, we will be fighting for the wealth of a nation! Possibly a match with the king as well. Will the group's
greed be their down fall? What other tricks does King Iorveli have up his sleave? Find out, next time!
