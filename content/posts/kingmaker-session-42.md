The group takes on the Sha'Goth! The fight proves to be challenging. The group
also learns of a dark discovery from Korog.

## The Maddening Cacophony  

The creature emerges from the stone walls of a pit. Countless mouths mumbling and
screaming together.

The dark mass wasted no time approaching the party, attacking with thick strands of its
form. Additionally, the party started being affected by the countless voices of the creature.

Suzaku and Rox struggled with the voices. Beginning to attack wildly. Thankfully, the
creature was the closest thing to them, resulting in some damage being done to it.

## Engulfed!

Springing off the cave walls, the creature surges forward, engulfing Suzaku and Rox in
its twisting form.

This presents a unique opportunity for Rox but is disastrous for Suzaku who starts
to take serious damage.

Thankfully, Stetson is ready and provides healing.

## Calling Down The Thunder

The creature turns out to be very tough, but eventually, Smoke is able to land a solid
spell strike. Chunking the creature and bringing it under half HP. 

Soon after, Rox lands a solid strike from within the creature. Bursting out of it in the
process.

The end finally came when Stetson sustained his Storm Cloud for the final time. The creature
fails its save and takes massive damage. Ending it.

## Conclusion

After licking their wounds, Korog comes bearing bad news. The cult did not have the means
to summon Yog'Soth themselves, but have turned the very walls of the cave into a focus lense.
This cave would act like a beacon, attracting Yog'Soth's attention.

In a few hundred or thousand years the old god would arrive and Golarian would be destroyed.

The party learns that they could undo this if they find the ritual to undo the spell on the cave.
They decide their best chance is to go looking in the garden's where the cult stores some of their
relics. Tune in next time, where the party will face more monstrosities and *hopefully* come out
on top.
