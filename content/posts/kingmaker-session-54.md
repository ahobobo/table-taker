The group enters the Lantern King's realm. Becoming the first mortals to ever do so.
They confront the king himself and begin to fight through his little game...

## The Realm of the Lantern King

The group steps through a portal that looks like a large flickering flame. The research
to create this portal took work from all of the group's caster's as well as some help
from Nyrissia herself. 

Stepping through, the group finds themselves in a void that almost looks like they where
floating far beyond in outer space.

A flickering flame approaches the group. Taunting them but also admitting that he is
impressed with them. Never before has a group of mortals come to him directly. For being
so entertaining, the king offers them a chance at living: complete his challenge and
defeat his avatar, and they would be rewarded.

## The Lantern King's Vision for Gloomwerth

The group is then transported to a strange realm. Familiar but also completely alien.
They find themselves in a Fey version of Gloomwerth. Overrun with wild growth and
mostly destroyed.

They see a clear path ahead of them and so make their way forward. Fighting strange
shape-shifting minions of the Lantern King called Fetches. They come in the form of
previous people they had befriended and fought. While they do prove to be fairly tough,
they are no match for the max level party.

## Conclusion

The group has so far not struggled with dealing with these lesser servants of the
Lantern King, however they have 3 islands to cross before they can fight the
Lantern King's avatar. On top of that, the king will only allow the group to rest 3
times for the entire gauntlet! What other challenges and blasts from the past will
the group encounter? Where is Nyrissia? All this and more will be learned ... Next time!
