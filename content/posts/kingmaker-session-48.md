The group protects their kingdom from Nyrissia. While also achieving the means
to take the fight to her...

## Worms in the Swamp

One of the minor blooms affecting the kingdom is located in the swamps of the west.
The group goes into the swamp to investigate and finds the bloom. As they approach to
take it out tho, the ground beneath them shakes and 2 giant worms burst forth.

The fight ends pretty quick! The worms are strong but the group is clearly stronger.
With the defeat of the worms the only minor bloom left is the one being guarded by the
frost giants...

## Frost Giants Fear

The frost giant's where friends of Gloomwerth but Nyrissia's invasion has spooked them.
They make their insecurities known when the group talks to them. Thankfully the heroes of
Gloomwerth are awesome at diplomacy.

Rox shows off his strength to impress the Frost Giants. Stetson uses reason and story to prove
that he is capable. Gregile assures the giants that he is great at leading. The final straw
was hearing that the group had constructed a OwlBear Chair of +1 Scare. Learning of this great
power the group has they conclude that the group does have a chance to take out Nyrissia.

## The Prime Bloom

With the minor blooms defeated all that remains was the prime bloom. A giant walking tree charged
with electrical power. The group finds and corners the strange creature. Starting the fight.

The tree has electrical and natural attacks. However, Rox is able to wrestle the tree. Preventing
it from casting its biggest spell! With it's tempo ruined the tree is seriously put in the back foot.
Some good strikes from Smoke are enough to burn the tree's health down quickly. The fight ends without
much of a fuss.

## Conclusion

With the essence of Nyrissia at hand, Suzaku is able to open a portal to Thousand Breaths.

What strange creatures will they find? What defenses does the Fey Queen have? Find out...
