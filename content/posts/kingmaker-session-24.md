The group begins investigating the lich's lair in ernest. Hoping to save the village of Varnhold.
Fighting some soul eaters, negotiating with a Nessy and
dispatching of some strong but decaying cyclopes zombies. They also learned that Vordakai was not
always a bad guy. However, something changed when a being known as the Lantern King arrived.

# Fight with the Soul Eaters

Sensing the presence of the group once more, Vordakai summoned beasts to dispatch of the group. These shadowy
monsters where resistant to physical attacks and also assaulted the group's minds and bodies with their attacks. Thankfully,
some effective spells and strikes where eventually able to destroy the creatures' immaterial form.

# Elasmosaurus Assistance

The group enters a flooded cave with a Elasmosaurus. The beast is hostile at first, but thankfully Stetson is able
to talk to beasts. He discovers the creature is being troubled by a foulness that keeps infecting it's water. He
would allow the group to pass, so long as they help him clean up.

Hiru is able to determine that the water was being fowled by the Lich's magics. She was also able to use her knowledge
of the occult to counteract the magic. Stetson and Smoke also lent their magic and where able to get the water cleaned
once more.

# Pottery Store

The group came across a room full of ancient pots. They showed a history of Vordakai when he was alive. Helping people
and performing miracles. The record ends with the arrival of someone called the Lantern King.

# River Trap

The next and last room of this floor was trapped. Thankfully, Gregile was able to use his keep goblin eyes to discover
it before the group triggered it. Rox was also able to discover that the statues in the hall they where in hid false
walls.

The trap was a solid metal portcullis that would have come down and trapped the group.

Rox decided to take on the challenge one piece at a time. Opening the false walls the statues hid. This revealed 2
cyclopes zombies. These slow but incredibly strong foes where rapidly decaying before the group. They got a few good
hits in but ultimately where reduced to dust after a few rounds.

# Conclusion

The group is well on their way to the second floor. However the Lich Vordakai is well aware of the group's presence.
He will no doubt have many more tricks and guards in the group's path.
