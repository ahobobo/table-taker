In this session, the group cleared out the rest of the trolls in the abandoned Dwarven Fort!
The group learned the name of the Fey Queen that has had influence over a few of their past encounters.
They also learned that they have a special guest waiting for them back home.

## Stetson Returns With a Message

The session starts with Stetson returning from checking up on the Kingdom. All is well, however an
unknown man wishes to have an audience with the group. He asked Stetson to bring the group back as
soon as possible. He told Stetson to bring the group this message: "I saw the Smoke signal...".

## Hargulka's Wrath

With the group reunited and the message received, the group goes onward to the second floor.
Ekundayo and Nagrundi are waiting for them. Ekundayo explains that Hargulka is held up in his
thrown room. Him and Nagrundi would deal with some troll stragglers that are on the Northern rooms of
the second floor. The group would deal with Hargulka.

The group accepts and bravely enter's the Troll Warlord's quarters. He is seated on a giant makeshift thrown.
A finely crafted mace crackling with small currents of electricity by his side. He is not upset by their presence,
in fact, he is pleased that they came here.

"I thought I would have to go all the way out to your kingdom to kill you. You traveling to me saves me that
inconvenience."

It's clear that the troll is well under the influence of the fey queen who has come to him in his dreams and
assured him that his victory is absolute. 

"Nyrissa assured me of my victory!" Hargulka exclaims as he charges into battle.

### A Hard Fought Victory!

Hargulka proved to be a hard hitting and resilient foe. He downed Rox and Smith with his devastating attacks.
Even shields proved to be ineffective against him as he ripped Rox's shield from him and bit at him when he was exposed.

If it wasnt for Stetson's timely healing, the group would have been flattened under his mace for sure!

Thankfully, the combination of Hiru's debuffs, Greggile's incendiary insults, Smith's fire infused spellstrikes, Steton's heals and some
powerful attacks from Rox where able to outlast Hargulka's incredible stamina and strength. The mighty troll was felled by a great
blast of static electricity from Stetson. Hargulka's final words where a plead to Nyrissa, asking how she could have forsaken him.

## Nagrundi Betrayed!

Shortly after killing Hargulka, Ekundayo and Nagrundi come to check up on them. Nagrundi is badly injured from his battle.

Ekundayo moves to have a word with the group in private, however, the group already knows what must be done.

Rox makes the first move, biting Nargrundi while his back was turned. The mighty troll is enragged and surprised but is
brought low shortly after. 

Ekundayo is impressed with the group's bloodlust. He promises to eliminate any stragglers. He also points the group to the troll's treasure room...

## The Troll's Treasures!

The group makes out with Hargulka's mace, worth over 2k gold! The treasure chamber also has about 500 gp worth of jewelry
and a special protective spirit can inhabit Rox's shield. Granting him the ability to block an attack without having to have
raised his shield before hand once per day!

## Back to Gloomwerth

With the trolls delt with, the group heads back to their capital, Rivercrest. Their audience with the mysterious new comer
awaits...
