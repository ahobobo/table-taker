The group infiltrates the castle proper! Freeing Terrion Numesti. Father of
Kisandra Numesti. They fight many guards as well as some hill giants towards
the end.

## Treasure Troves and Supplies Stores

Entering the castle via the secret tunnels underneath proved to be lucrative.

The first few rooms the group got into are supplies and coffers of the castle.
Helping themselves to the nice store of gold and treasure, the group went into
their first real challenge.

## Prison Chamber

The group found the prison chambers for the castle. Their one prisoner being
Terrion. The one nobel of Drelev that went against his surrender. He was guarded
by 2 guards who the group was able trick and dispatch of. 

Freeing him, he explained that Drelev was a good man. However, his jealousy and
pride have driven him to betray his principles and his people. 

Will this revelation grant him leniency? Who knows, Drelev is still held up in the
castles higher floors.

## Castle Grounds

Taking the stairs to the castle's ground floor, the group found the kitchen and some
more guards.

This time, one of the guards was able to wiggle his way out of the group's reach. He opened
the doors of the castle and called out for help. Unfortunately for the group, his cries where
answered...

## Pitax Hill Giants

The group had heard of these bruits from a guard they had captured, and now they would have to fight
them. A group of 6 hill giants came charging at the group. Thankfully, they had to squeeze through the castle's main door.

With the hill giant's grouped together the caster's of the group made quick work of most of them.

Down to two, they begged the group for their lives. Promising to never medel in their afairs again.

## Conclusion

The group's cover has been blown! However, Drelev is trapped in the castle's second floor.

The group knows that there is a wizard in the castle somewhere. Also Drelev is a powerful
fighter and likely will not go down without a fight. What will his final fate be? That is 
for the group and next session to decide!
