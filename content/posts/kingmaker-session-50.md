The group takes on a giant raven and a group of mire worms. The group plays out
an inversion of the famous alien scene where the xenomorph bursts out of the man's
chest in the process. They group ends the game at the gates to Nyrissia's castle.

## Raven's Roost

The session starts with the group facing off against the Nightmare Rook. The bird has
a pretty annoying combo where it would strafe the group. Making 2 claw attacks in the
process, while also grabbing one of the group members and ending the turn by pecking
at the unlucky soul that was grabbed. 

Thankfully, powerful heals from Stetson are able to keep the group up. The fight ends 
after a devastating Disintegrate spellstrike from Smoke that reduces the bird to cinders.

## Mired in the Mire

Nyrissia's realm still holds after killing the bird, if just barely. The group decides to
test their luck in the swampy part of the forest. They feel a familiar rumbling under their feet.

4 Mire Worms pop out and surround the group. The situation quickly gets worst as Gregile and
Suzaku are instantly swallowed whole. Thankfully, Gregile is able to muster his psychic might to
burst out of the worm's chest. Smoke also lands a good hit on the worm holding Suzaku, freeing her
and allowing her to finish off another worm. The final worm gets shattered by Stetson with a powerful
ice attack. Freezing the creature solid.

## Thousand Breath's Collapse

With the worms defeated, the magic holding much of Thousand Breaths together fails. Causing the 
group to reappear in the Stolen Lands. However, now there is a tear in the sky over the Temple of
the Elk. The group enters it and finds themselves in a clearing with many statues of different species.
Some they have seen, many they have not. 

A Gatehouse with a tall tower stands before them. Guarding a bridge leading to a castle overlooking a lake.
A shadow atop the tower stirs...

## Conclusion

The group has made it to Nyrissia's castle, but they must face one final guardian before they can enter.
Will the group be able to face this final guardian? Or will they be her lunch? Find out, next time !
