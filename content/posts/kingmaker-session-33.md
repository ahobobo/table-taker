Short and sweet! The group completes Zortec's challenge and learns more about the nature
of Orvinbane.

## Zortec's Challenge

Zortec leads the group into a natural cave portion of the tomb. Explaining that their final test
before Armag himself would be to vanquish the unworthy.

With a small gesture, Zortec summons a group of skeletal Tiger Lords for the group to defeat!

These dammed souls where warriors of the past that had attempted to take Orvinbane over the centuries.
They did not have the strength to withstand the traps and challenges of the tomb. Ultimately, they ended up
losing their lives and their freedom. 

The ensuing battle was tough. The skeletal warriors having resistances to a lot of the main damage types of
the group. Thankfully, the group was able to dispatch of them with minimal loss of resources. Spells, hammers
and claws proving to be more than enough to end the after lives of these spooky skeletons.

## Conclusion

Pleased with the group's performance, Zortec leads the group deeper into the tomb, explaining that Armag is in the
next chamber.

As he leads them, Zortec asks Gregile why a Pharasmin like him would want to take the blade. He explains that the
nature of Orvinbane is to cause conflict. Taking it from this tomb would cause conflict.

The group ponders his words and explain that they simply wish to stop Armag from taking their kingdom. The blade would
then be in their care.

Zortec is impressed with their might and wishes to see what battles the rulers of Gloomwerth might get into.
He offers to protect the blade for the group in their kingdom if they can kill Armag and get the blade from him.
