The final battle and grand finally to the Kingmaker Adventure Path! The group
takes on the Lantern King's Avatar. Fighting not only his physical form, but
his second in command as well! 

## Sizing Up

The Lantern King sits atop a thrown in a human looking form. Nyrissia caged by his side.
Before engaging the group, he talks to them. Attempting to make them join his side.

Rox is itching for a fight and his ferocity shines through in all his interactions with
the King. Smoke, Gregile, Suzaku, and Stetson take a more tamed approach. Entertaining the
lantern king's talks.

After a brief back and forth, its clear that the group is not backing down. Additionally, the
group shows their resolve is unmatched. This frightens the Lantern King's lesser subjects who
will spend much of the rest of the fight fleeing.

## The Battle Begins! 

With talks concluded, the fight starts. The king transforms into his true form, a giant fireball
with the heat of the sun. 
The group spends much of the first round casting their best buffs. The Lantern King uses the 
opportunity to Fireball the group. Hitting everyone. The start
looks rough, but now its the group's turn to take the initiative.

Rox charges in and engages the Lantern King directly. Meanwhile, Werendegar flanks the group. Landing
a devastating blow on Gregile. Thankfully, he is able to use timestop to make distance and heal himself.

Suzaku lays down the pain. Casting 2 Shadow Armies on top of the King. These massive area spells would
remain a constant thorn in the king's side for the rest of the battle. Stetson lands massive heals and
discovers that the Lantern King is weak to cold damage.

## Trickery

The Lantern King is a trickster and reveals his special ability: making his foes swap places. He does so several
times, forcing Rox away while bringing the backline to him. Suzaku and Stetson end up taking lots of damage
from this ability.

Smoke dedicates himself to dealing with Werendegar. Dueling the Glimmerling while the rest of the group focuses
the king. Eventually, Werendegar falls and Smoke moves to support the rest of the team.

## Final Blows

As the rounds roll on, the King seems to be running out of steam. Before he goes down, he lands 2 big attacks.
He blinds Suzaku. Forcing Stetson to come to her aid. He is able to restore her, but he neglects his own
health in the process. Seeing this, the King makes Smoke and Stetson swap places. He then downs the fairy.

Down one teammate, and to far from the King to spellstrike, Smoke decides to use Force Barrage to try and take
down the King. The magic flows out of him and surge to the arrogant god. The missiles strike true, and destroy
the Lantern King's Avatar.

## Upholding His Word

At the start of this chapter, the Lantern King promised to grant them all a wish if they could survive his
gauntlet. The group not only did so, but did so while only resting once! Impressed and humbled by these
exceptional mortals, the Lantern King's true form towers over the group in the sky.

"I promise to never meddle in your affairs again. I will also grant each of you a wish..."

Smoke wishes for the 999 kingdoms to be restored. Suzaku wishes for all these kingdoms to be connected
with Gloomwerth in the center of them as their capital. Gregile wishes for the utter destruction of
Tarkucio's soul, Stetson wishes to know who and where his true parents are and Rox wishes to become the
god of primordial creation.

## Conclusion of the Adventure

Over the coming days and weeks, Stetson would go on a journey to find his parents. Gregile would return to
his hobgoblin tribe with his hard earned riches and power. Suzaku would manage relations between the many new
kingdoms that where now under Gloomwerth's rule. Smoke would read and absorb all the knowledge provided by
these new kingdoms and worlds.

Over the coming years Lilu, Rox's daughter, would train and take on her father's passion. Rox would also use
his new found divinity to make Gloomwerth into a primordial paradise. Complete with domesticated dino's and
other creatures long thought extinct.

Having bested a god, Gloomwerth would become the greatest kingdom in the history of Golarion and indeed even
the universe.
