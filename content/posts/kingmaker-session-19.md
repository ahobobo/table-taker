In this short session the group makes a key discovery about the affliction spreading across the land and launch an
investigation to find the source of the corruption.

## A Feast Gone Wrong

After winning the competition, the Embeth Travelers held a feast to celebrate the group's accomplishments.

Sadly the feast was interrupted by a most unwelcome occurrence. In the middle of the feast, one of the waiters started
to feel unwell and made a hell of a scene. Yelling and screaming he ran out of the hall to the back of a stable.

At this point he had torn off his clothing and revealed that his body seemed to be getting ravaged from the inside. Roots and vines
writhing within, causing the poor man to twitch and cry out in pain.

Smoke acted quickly, attempting to put the poor waiter out of his misery before he became a threat. He brought his hammer down on the
man but his body crumpled like a sheet and a terrible basilisk sprung out of his chest. Seeming to violate the laws of physics with
this massive creature erupting from the man's small frame.

A fierce battle ensued. Rox holding down the beast with his mighty claws. Gregile using his occult and psychic abilities to aid his friends and
pummel the beast from afar. Taking advantage of this combination of factors, Smoke readied himself for a massive attack. Hitting the beast square on
its head with his magically charged hammer the beast was brought within an inch of death in an instant. Stetson finished the beast with a well aimed
ray of frost.

## Investigation and Intrigue

Up to this moment the group had only seen the bloom affect beasts and the land. People had not been affected by it. However, this changes things.
The treat to the kingdom and indeed the entire stolen lands had become clear and it needed to be stopped.

Unfortunately, the group had no idea how to stop this. So they began to research for answers. Using their wits and magic, they analyzed the bodies of
the victims to discover that the corruption was not just magical in nature but a curse that was placed on the land. It seems that it is a forerunner of
a summoning. They also discovered that Greengripe, the headquarters of the cult of the bloom that they had learned about earlier, is a smoke screen. The
goblins that call Greengripe home dont actually know about the cult's real activities and have nothing to do with the curse. All the goblins, but one. The
group has seen this goblin sneak out of his village and talk with a strange hooded figure.

## Conclusion

With a clear suspect in their sites, the group is ready to confront the cult and bring an end to this curse.
