The group begins working to stop Nyrissia. While also looking for
a way to bring the fight to her.

## The True Nature of the Invasion

Nyrissia's invasion of the stolen lands is not just one of occupation...

While researching the magics that brought the Horned Hunter into this world,
Smoke realized that they have seen magic like this before, however its nature
is different. Like the Bloom that infected living creatures before, the very land
itself is being infected with Nyrissia's fey magic.

If she succeeds, she would not just infest the stolen lands with endless fey, she
would bring the whole kingdom into her own pocket plain.

## Stopping the Blooms

Rox being a master of the terrain, was able to scout out 3 blooms. The group
would have to take care of these blooms to assure the safety of the kingdom.

However, the problem of Nyrissia remains. As it stands she is unreachable. Safe
in a different plain... Thankfully the group has Suzaku. She has been learning
all about summoning and bringing things from other plains into this world. Reversing
the process would be possible. Especially with the help of her patron, Hiru.

Hiru suspects that a piece of Nyrissia's essence would be in the blooms sprouting
around the stolen lands, and one of them might be strong enough to use as a portal
to Nyrissia.

## Abominable Giants

The group decides to take on a group of monsters that have been terrorizing their farmers
to the north east. These strange monsters had a long thin third arm. The arm had sharp claws
as well.

They where no pushovers. Tanky and fairly dangerous for our squishy casters, the group
sweat a bit. Thankfully, the group was able to pull through with a combination of healing
from Stetson, Damage from Gregile and Smoke and control from Suzaku.

## Conclusion

With the giants defeated. The group witnessed the bloom they where guarding wither and dissipate.
Suzaku gathers the blooms remnants and hears a name in her head: Thousand Breaths.

With the name of their destination in mind, all that remains is for the group to take on the rest
of the blooms plaguing their kingdom. Then they can bring the fight to Nyrissia...

Will the group succeed? Is following Hiru's plan really the smartest thing to do? Find out... Next time!
