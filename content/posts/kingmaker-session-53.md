The group confront's Nyrissia. Learning about her downfall and preventing the destruction of
their kingdom. The group also learns of the true final threat that they will have to deal
with...

## Nyrissia's Domain

Last time the group decided to rest up before entering another one of Nyrissia's demi plans. The
moment they where ready, the group stood around the bed and envisioned entering the plan...

Before seeing the demiplane's form, the group sees a memory. This time, Nyrissia is on her hands and
knees. Kneeling before a floating flame. A deep masculine voice echos from everywhere. It declares
that Count Ranalc has been banished but her fate was still in question. It then manifested a glass
vile. It said that this would be her apology. She would be stripped of her love and happiness and
only made whole again after it was filled.

The domain then manifested. It was a fantastical garden. Nyrissia stood next to a statue of herself.
She asks the group if they know how the Apology works. She answers her own question by saying it absorbs
kingdoms after she kills their leaders. Conveniently all the leaders of Gloomwerth where standing before
her right now.

Stetson tried to reason with her. Offering Beakie's Feather as a peace offering. However, the queen was
not hearing it. The fight begins.

## Blinding Beauty

The queen is one of the most beautiful mortal creatures to have ever live. Her beauty is so powerful, that
it functions as a powerful aura that blinds foes who get to close.

Gregile and Smoke are blinded right off the bat. Things go from bad to worst when Rox gets hit with an
Uncontrollable Dance spell. The queen remains mobile while all of this is happening. Dodging spells from Stetson
Suzaku and Gregile.

## Smoke Strikes True

Thankfully after being burned down a little by spells from Suzaku, Smoke is able to get close to the fey
queen once more. He activates true strike and lands a powerful blow with Gloom's Wrath. The cold iron vorp
blade deals significant damage to the Nymph. Seeing that she is not long for this world she surrenders, leaving
her life in the hands of the party.

## Forgiveness

The group decides to spare her. She is grateful and pledges to help in anyway that she can. 

She reveals that the lantern king has access to an elite fey group known as The Wild Hunt. They
would be coming for the group soon. In fact, the only reason the group was not dead right now was
because the lantern king was likely still plotting how best to punish the group.

## Conclusion

The group has gained a powerful allie and an even more powerful foe. They also have leveled up to 20!
Gaining access to the peak power of their classes.

The group came to the conclusion that instead of waiting for the Lantern King to come for them, they would
go to him. With Nyrissia's help and Gregile's occult knowledge the group would plane travel to the realm of
the Lantern King and take the fight to him.
