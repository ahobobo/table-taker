The group participates in something called the Rushlight Tournament! Winning a prize.

They also come face to face with King Irvetti for the first time! Learning about him
and getting to know what makes him tick.

## Arrival and Festivities

The Tournament is more of a grand carnival with games and food all over. The group is able to
have some fun interacting with the locals and enjoying the show.

After a short time, the group is summoned to meet king Irovetti himself. They agree to see him.

The king is a tall handsome human male. The group first encounters him singing and making music.
He is courteous and polite to the group. He explains that the group has a chance to win some gold
and a wand. The competition will be held over 5 days. Each of them can compete in one of the games.

## Encounters with The King

The group is successfully able to compete and win in the tournament. They also each get a chance to learn
about the king. 

Suzaku was first. Being invited to a "private discussion" with the king at the evening. She is able to
find that the king is not a native of the Stolen Lands. She also learns that he has some plans for moving
his army north west. With a particular hex being circled in red ink.

Smoke has a double feature. He discovers the king disciplining a guard that angered him. He seems to kill
the guard using a strange weapon he always wields. A metal staff with spikes that are shot out with a mechanical
device within the staff. 

Smoke chastises the king for his wastefulness and cruelty. The king is displeased with the Gnoll, but
decides against escalation for the sake of the festivities. Later that night, Smoke sneaks around the
barracks. He overhears that the guards have been watching them.

The next day, Stetson is next. He encounters the king who seems genuinely happy to get a chance to talk
with him. He learns that King Irovetti loves the Fae and has visited the First World. He is currently in
love with Queen Narrissia and has some sort of blessing from her. He states that if it wasnt for her,
he would have never been able to be a king now.

Gregile gets invited by the king to be shown a great treasure that he has. He shows the king the relic
blade Briar. This blade is said to have a piece of the fae queen's soul imbued within. Gregile then
reveals that the group has a Owlbear Chair of +1 Scare. The king is taken aback and jealous of the
group's great treasure. 

Rox does not get an audience with the king but he learns something very important. The king has an army of
Hill giants and Wyverns that he had stationed near the fair grounds. The army also started to move north east
to Gloomswerth by the end of the day. 

## The Plot Revealed

The night of the final day of the tournament, the group is awoken by a disturbance. Nok Nok has killed
2 Pitax Wardens. He explains they where going to set fire to the group's tent. The King has also been moving armies north west
to Gloomswerth. The king was using the Tournament to keep the group distracted while he moved his armies.
He also revealed that the king has some sort of super weapon to the north west. 

A detachment of wardens hear the commotion and come to attack the group. The Wardens are strong, but a 
powerful spell from Suzaku early on in the fight ensures that they are rendered ineffective for the rest
of the battle.

## Conclusion

With Pitax making their move, the group is now in a hot war with them directly. The group has some armies to dispatch as well
as a super weapon to disable. How it will play out is unclear, but one thing is for certain, its going to end
with a battle against king Irovetti himself.
