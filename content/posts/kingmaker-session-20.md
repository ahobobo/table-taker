New year new problems for our merry band! In this session, the group started by visiting Greengripe. Then they started their
direct assault on the Cult of the Bloom. Hoping to stop them once and for all. They also made some new friends from old
enemies. 

## Greengripe

The party began play at the ramshackle town of Greengripe. This goblin settlement had clearly seen better days. Half of the town had
been burned down and the food stores of the town where clearly in the red. 

The only red meat the town had was a goat named Tomorrowfood and a pickle store. Hiru sarcastically suggested the town should procreate with the goat
to produce more food. The dim witted goblins took this literally and started to mock the group for their depraved customs. 

The group found many strange things in the town. Including a burned goblin corpse in the burned section of town. He had a silver holly symbol.
He also had a almost completely burned set of priest robes. A nearby alchemist goblin lady confirmed that this was the corpse of their leader. Meaning
the current leader was not who he said he was.

## Confronting the Imposter

After a brief fight, it was revealed that the current goblin leader was actually a doppelganger. What was even stranger was that on revealing his
true form... he had bright purple hair and long ears.

Tarkucio had been brought back from the Abyss by the Cult of the Bloom and turned into a doppelganger by the cult. He did not want to return to hell
and so begged for mercy. Rox used his ghost absorbing coffin shield to lock Tarkucio's soul in it. saving him from hell without giving him a free
pass.

## Clearing Up the Cave

With Tarkucio as a guide, the group was able to find the cult's lair. A very damp and mushroom infested cave on the side of a cliff face. The group has
so far cleared a few groups of cultists but many dangers still lurk deeper in these caves.

A noteable discovery the group made after the first fight was learning the Varnhold (a settlement established by another envoy of Brevoy) was having
troubles of the magical variety. They had sent a courier out to Brevoy to try and ask for help, but the poor man was caught and killed by the cultists.

## Conclusion

The group has started to clear out the cult. They have learned about some other threats to the north east. We also have the return of the great
and powerful Tarkucio. The group will likely clear out the rest of the camp next time. They are also likely going to learn more about the Cult and
other happenings in the Stolen Lands.
