The group plunder's the depths of the Tomb of Armag! They face several challenges and save the last
of the Iron Wraiths. 

The party feels the divine presence of Gorum emanating off the walls of this holly site. The tomb consists
of smooth stone walls lined with white glowing metal.

## Sister's of the Bloodshot Eye

2 young Witches stang guard at the entrance to the Tomb. They explain that their queen has foreseen the return
of Armag. They would be the ones to force the hand of fate. The group asks about the Iron Wraiths, almost in
response, the group hears the sound of a female scream.

The Witches put some damage on the group but ultimately go down. They seem to be ill suited for fighting and
pass out when they go low.

Not taking any chances, the group kills off the witches as they are knocked down.

## Test of Tactics  

Moving East, the party encounter's a room with a white statue staring at the wall to the south. Following it's
gaze, Suzaku notices the wall is actually illusory. 

The Party enters a hall with runes painted on it all throughout. When the party makes it to the middle of the hall, 
the runes glow and glitter. 2 Demons spawn, blocking off the party on both ends of the hall.

The fight proves to be a little harder than the one with the witches. They fight hard and deal significant damage
to the whole group. Thankfully, Rox and Smoke are able to tear the demons apart.

## Maria Margrave

After the demon's defeat, the party hears the struggled breaths of a woman. Going to the end of the hall, the group
finds Maria Margrave, last of the Iron Wraiths. She explains that her companions have been killed by the tests of the
tomb. She is the sole survivor.

She warns the party of the next challenge. The Iron Golem.

## Iron Golem

Ever the book worm, Smoke recalls knowledge about Iron Golems. They are resistant to most forms of damage and magic.
The only things that can get past their defenses are Adamantite and Acid attacks.

The party makes use of this knowledge. Gregile casting Dragon Form to turn himself into an Adamantite Dragon. The rest
of the party ensuring they prepared acidic spells and attacks to take on the creature.

The party's prep paid off. Smoke and Gregile landing crushing blows on the first round. Nearly dropping the creature.

However, it was Rox who landed the finishing blow. Using his acidic jaws to chew through the monster... literally !

## Conclusion

When the golem was defeated, the group was able to recover an Adamantite ingot from its corpse.

As the party rested and patched up their wounds, they are approached by a strange man. He introduces himself as Zorek.

He saids that he is charged with ensuring the Orvbane is used by the worthy. He has watched the group face many challenges
and believes that they might be worthy. However, he has one last challenge for them to ensure their worthyness.

The session ends with the party agreeing to follow Zorek and take on his test...
