The group begins to explore Thousandbreaths! Coming face to face with Nyrissia herself!

## Enter Thousandbreaths

The group goes through the portal and enter's Nyrissia's domain. They find themselves at the start of
a forest with an iron arch. Resting at the base sits a Nymph. 

Ever the ladies man, Stetson introduces himself and the group. The Nymph reveals herself to be Nyrissia.

The conversation sours quickly as the Lantern King's name is mentioned. However, Nyrissia let loose
a critical piece of info: her domain is held together by her lieutenants. Killing or removing them
would mean the realm could collapse. 

## Beware the Jabberwocky

Nyrissia left a friend to great the party to her realm. A Lesser Jabberwocky. The creature lumbered to
the group, and the group was well prepared.

Rox held the creature down, preventing it from flying. Meanwhile Smoke, Stetson, Gregile and Suzaku all pummeled the
creature. The mighty beast was able to land a few solid blows but was brought low by the group's relentless assault.

## Swan Lake

The first area the group finds is a swan lake with dead tree's lining the area. Smoke investigates one
of these trees and gets bitten! The combat is quick and the group chops the tree down.

## Frost Graveyard

A frost giant with 4 arms lives here in a frozen graveyard. He confronts the group, but does not immediately
attack. He explains he is honor bound to help Nyrissia. For she saved him long ago. The group explains that his
clan of Frost Giants are in their kingdom. With some good negotiations from Rox, Stetson and Suzaku he relents.
The group takes him back home.

The group also takes the chance to regain their strength and craft new weapons and armour. Of particular note, is
Gloom's Wrath. A Vorpal Sword crafted by Smoke to help in dealing with any other Jabberwockys that they might
encounter...

## Conclusion

The group ends the night encountering a giant Raven sitting atop a spire. The group tries to speak with it, but
it rushes to battle.

How will the group handle a flying foe? Will Nyrissia's domain collapse with the death of this lieutenant?
