The king's palace!

## The Gardener

The words of the mercenaries stationed here where true! The Abby has long been haunted by a powerful malevolent
spirit. The group encounters at the end of a damp cave.

The spirit is not alone, feeding on it's torment are several Will'o Wisps! The group enters combat right away.

The Ghost and Wisp are resistant, but are cleaned up by the group. Despite having limited options, the casters of
the group are able to buff up Rox and Smoke who cleave down their foes.

## The Water Nimph

With the ghost vanquished, the group reaches into a pool of glowing water at the center of the cave. A sealed glass
jar floating within.

Opening the jar, water begins to poor out into the pool. A few moments later, a beautiful lady with striking blue
eyes emerges from the water.

She thanks the group for their help. Explaining that the ghost was once a friend, however he was driven mad by Bane.
The blade that holds a piece of Nerissia's soul. 

The group asks for her to help them reach king Irovelli. She agrees. However, they must return Bane to her.

## Conclusion

The group enters the nimph's pool. Slowly, they sink into the water, slowly dissolving into the pool before
submerging completely. They feel like they are under water for a moment. Before drowning, they reemerge from
a fountain in the king's castle.

The group is immediately discovered by troll guards stationed there. A Nat 20 deception roll ensures that the group
is able to enter the castle without sparking a fight.

Next session the group will begin to explore the palace. Looking for the king himself. Will the group be able to defeat
the most elite warriors that Pitax has to offer? Find out next time!
