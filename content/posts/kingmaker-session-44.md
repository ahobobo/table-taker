The group takes on a quest from a space slaver before having second thoughts about it.
They then end up making new friends and learning what must be done in order to destroy the
focusing lense once and for all.

## The Leng's Request

The leng that helped the group before turns out to want nothing more than to leave. However in order
to return to his ship, he needs a source of power... The cloth of the Monitor's should do it.

The Monitors are the angels that helped the Pharasmins fight the cult when they first assaulted this place.
They are powerful beings, and their cloth is infused with magic.

The group using invisibility and skills to obtain their goal without breaking the Monitor's stasis or
raising the Pharasmin's suspicions.

## Second Thoughts

As the group is going back down to hand over the cloth, he expresses second thoughts about the whole thing.
These creatures are space slavers and letting them leave would be immoral.

After some discussion, the rest of the group agrees. They find the Leng with his associate and two naive monks
that wish the join the Leng in space. Not realizing that they would be slaves.

The battle is intense. The Leng have cursed mandables that increasingly debilitate their foes. However, the group
is able to dispatch them. The monks, seeing their masters beat, surrender.

## Conclusion

The group takes in the monks who simply wanted a way out of the cult and saw the Leng as their ticket. The monks
explain that in order to destroy the focusing lense, the group would need to perform a ritual and use a special
stone tablet guarded by Feng, the leader of the cult. They also reveal Feng's location to the group.

With the ritual found, all that remains is to kill Feng and destroy the focusing lense once and for all.
