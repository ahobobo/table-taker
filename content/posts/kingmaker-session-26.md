The group takes on Vordakai the cyclopes lich! This is the toughest foe the group has faced to this point. 

## Guardian Elemental

Before the group could fight the lich, they had to get past his guardian! A water elemental empowered with
the souls of the dammed. This monster proved to have some fight in him. Almost taking out 3 party members in
one massive surge of water. Thankfully, the group was able to reorient themselves and lay down the hurt on
the monster. 

## The Fight Starts! 

With the guardian dispatched, the group enters the lich's chambers. Both parties getting a good look at each other
for the first time. He recognized them. The Fey Queen Nyrissa said that she had dealt with the party. 

He cursed the her for lying and said that when the Lantern King returns she would be punished and he would be
rewarded for killing them.

His first move in the fight was to cast Dominate on Stetson! He failed the save and was turned to the lich's side.
His command being to attack Smith and protect the lich. This thankfully only lasted for a single turn since on the
next one Stetson was able to shake off the control and rejoin his allies.

## Things Take a Turn for the Worst!

After a few rounds of attacks from both sides, the lich found himself cornered and had no choice but to fight.

Sensing the threat of the group's Magus, the lich decided to try and take him out of the fight. Unfortunately
for our heroes, he was successful! He struck at Smoke with his boney hands and drained him of his life force.

Try as he might, Smoke was unable to resist the lich's powerful magics and dropped to the floor! Seemingly dead
but in truth he was paralyzed just like the Centaur Princess the party had rescued earlier. 

Down one of their main damage dealers, the group started to feel a little nervous about the fight. However,
the worst was yet to come. At this point, the lich had sustained a good amount of damage and he knew he needed
to do something about it lest he perish. He let loose his terrible arcane might and casted Vampiric Extinguashion.
Hitting the entire party with many of them critically failing their saving throws. 

Not only was the group down a member, many of them where also in critical condition after the lich's terrible spell.

## A Hard Victory!

Throughout the fight, Rox had been constantly assaulting the lich. Tripping him over and over and Biting ferociously.
The lich attempted to retaliate. Striking at Rox in the same way that he struck at Smoke. Thankfully, the lizard's
fortitude did not waiver. He was able to resist the lich's paralyzing touch and at this point had shredded through
the healing he got from Vampiric Extinguation.

Additionally Gregile, Stetson and Suzaku where also hitting the lich with their strongest spells. Pummeling him with
lightning, telekinetic projectiles and shadowy magics. 

Then came the final round. The Vordakai was in critical condition and he knew it. If he stayed to fight any further, he
would surly perish. So, he attempted to make his exit. He conjured the last of his strength and attempted to cast
dimensional door. If he was successful then the party would have to be on the look out for this unholy creature wandering
the Stolen Lands. Causing havoc and putting countless innocents in danger.

Thankfully, Rox has reactive strike. Before the lich could escape Rox bit into him hard. Breaking his fragile bones.
Unable to withstand this level of punishment, Vordakai finally was destroyed. His final words, a warning to the group.
Declaring that the Lantern King would return and that when he did, the group would be powerless to stop him.

## Conclusion

With Vordakai defeated his terrible magics where dispelled. The town of Varnhold had been sealed in soul jars within the
Lich's chambers. They began to appear from these jars one by one. Among them where some lizard folk. Rox identified them
as childhood friends. They revealed that their was another lizard folk village to the south of the previous one the group
had interacted with

Additionally, the group found some other goodies. They learned the location of peacebloom and a Parasmin tomb. Suzaku found
some salts that are vital for performing powerful summoning rituals and Smoke found the recipe for creating a soul cage. 

However, these extras would have to wait. For the party had more pressing concerns. The river kingdoms and Pitax had
signed a cease fire! Additionally, word had gotten out that they where amassing their armies to the west. This troubling
news is what the party will be taking on in the next chapter of Kingmaker!
