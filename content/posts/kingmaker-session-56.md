The group takes on the REAL Jaberwok! They have an intense fight and finally enter the
Palace of the Lantern King...

## Jaws That Bite

The Jaberwok's island was overrun with vegetation and plants. This made the entire battlefield
greater rough terrain. This large limitation of moment did not apply to the Jaberwok who
could naturally move through the bush unimpeded.

The group immediately took a few good hits from the beast. Rox in particular got chunked right
at the start. Even so, Gregile was able to ground the beast when it tried to fly away, Suzaku was
able to greatly weaken it, Smoke landed powerful blows, Stetson shocked the beast with his magic and Rox
grabbed the beast and held it tightly as soon as it was grounded again.

The team proved to be more than capable and defeated the beast. However, that was not the last of their
challenges...

## Golems and Steel Men

Angered that the group had defeated his favorite pet, the Lantern King animated ruined statues scattered
on the island. They immediately attacked the group, giving them no chance to recover from the Jaberwok fight.

Thankfully, the group had dealt with foes much stronger than these golems. They fell in short order.

## Conclusion

Watching the group's battle the whole time was none other than Werendegar. A servant of the Lantern King they
had interacted with on the first island. He congratulates them on their victory and offers to take them to the
King. The group accepts after they take their first rest for the dungeon.

With the Lanter King's trial defeated, the group faces their final challenge... Will the group succeed? Find out...
Next time!
