The group reaches the next main event! They dealt with some squatting gnomes that had set up camp in the
empty Varnhold as well as learning about the great Ogre Lich, Vordakai from the Centaurs. The group had
just defeated some guardians for his tomb and had opened the way deeper into the tomb...

## Spriggan Special

In town, the group split up an was able to discover the following things..

- a group of Spriggans had set up shop in the empty town. They are currently helping themselves to towns
supplies since no one is stopping them.
- Stetson was able to talk with a pet cat. The cat revealed that the town went outside one day and everyone vanished.
- The town had recently sent an expedition to a place known as Vodakai's Island. They had stolen a necklace from this place
and had brought it back to town.

Not wanting to bother with the Spiggans the group was able to successfully negotiate with them and learned the location of
the Centaurs.

## Harassing Horses

Moving South East, the group quickly found themselves in Centaur territory and staring down a group of angry Centaurs.

As it turns out, Varnhold has been fighting the centaurs and they are extremely suspicious of the group.

This changed when King Gregile gave a passionate and rousing diplomacy check. The centaurs realized that Vordakai has
awakened and that they are going to need all the help they can in order to ensure that he does not take over the stolen
lands. 

## Entering Vordakai's Tomb

On a river to the south west of the Centaur's village, a small island sits. This seemingly empty island held a small clift face
that had a set of stone doors. Entering the structure, the group sees human tracks and some spilled treasure. Clearly, this
is where the Varnhold explorers had entered and taken some treasure from.

## Conclusion

The group encounter's the first set of guardians. A pair of Leukodaemons. They prove powerful but eventually fall to the group's
might. Smith, Greg and Rox do unfortunately catch a bad case of the sick. The group attempts to sleep off the effects but
unfortunately they all awake feeling drained.

Next time, the group will dive deeper into the debts. hopefully finding a way to restore the villagers of Varnhold...
