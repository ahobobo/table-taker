Wanda starts her journey through the dungeons. Running into mysterious new Rooks and contracting a strange
disease. She finds an impossibly large Rook, chained and long dead. Then she is forced to push forward as
the way back is locked off to her.

## Scene 1

I have landed in a large dark chamber that seems to branch out into hallways. I would have never believed that the Colostle
held such secretes hidden under its rooms if I had not fallen into them myself.

Thankfully, life still seems to be plentiful in this dimly lit land. Strange fruit trees grow between the cracks of the massive
stone bricks that make up most of the floor. Light spills in from distant cracks in the ceiling high above. Trickling streams of
fresh water are abundant. Seeming to flow from high above as well as from the massive walls of these chambers.

However, all is not well. I have only just begun my journey but I have already been attacked by 2 strange Rooks.

The first came out of nowhere. A tall pale form of a Rook that seemed to come out of a solid wall. It immediately brought its
massive stone great sword down on my head. I was only just barely able to doge out of the way. When I tried to retaliate, the Rook
had already partially disappeared back into the wall. The last part of it to completely fade away being a chain that was attached to
its leg.

The second was an overgrown Rook covered in dark green vines. If it was not trying to kill me, I would have pitied the creature. The
vines clogged its gears and slowed its movements. Despite this, the creature did prove to be a nuisance. Firing the vines at me and
even controlling the moss under my feet. I dispatched the Rook with some well placed strikes, the vine infested stone crumbling with
ease.

The battle left me covered in the strange vegetation. Took me the rest of the day to get it all off, tho I still think I have some
stubborn pieces of the stuff on my gear.

## Scene 2

As I traveled, I found a truly massive chamber. Empty of any features aside for what I could only describe as a Rook the size of a
mountain. It's lifeless form was laid out on one of the walls of the room. Arms chained up over its head and legs stretching out from
the wall it laid on to the other side of the room. I mumbled a silent thanks. Grateful that this beast was long dead and not a threat.

One of the walls of the room was a door, just as large as the dead Rook. It was sealed shut and proved to be impossible to pass.

The wall behind the Rook provided an exit. A crack in the wall that seemed to be excavated to allow for people to pass through.
Unfortunately, the wooden supports that held open the entrance had been rotted and I almost was buried under rubble when I tried
to examine one of them. The way back out is closed off to me now, but at least I still have a way forward.

I also have noticed that no matter how many times I clean my gear, the dammed lichen from the second Rook keeps appearing! The stuff
just doesn't go away, almost as if it was growing back on my stuff quicker than I could remove it. I keep finding it on my fur and it has
made my fingernails turn dark green with how much I have scratched it off.

## Scene 3

The passage I found lead to another smaller, but still massive room.

As I was foraging for the day, I was almost beset by 2 Lichen Rooks. One large and the other smaller. They shambled out of a
ruined door the room was connected to and would likely have spotted me if I had not hidden in the foliage.

Not wanting to run into them again, I decided to go through the door they came out of. It exited into a wide hallway with
stone supporting columns the size of city blocks. They stretched high up beyond site. The same lichen that was growing on the
Rooks seems to be common in this area. It was growing on every piece of stone I could see. It glowed faintly, providing
light in this otherwise pitch black area.

I also can not longer deny that the stuff is growing on me. I will get itches throughout the day and each time I scratch, I pull out
another strand of the stuff. As I write this, my mind cant help but go back to the shambling overgrown Rooks I have encountered. I
hope I can find a solution to this soon, lest I end up like them.
