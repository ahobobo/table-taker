# The Gratitude of the Lizard People!  

This session started off with our marry band of misfits in the Lizard People Village. They had previously helped them with
their Wispified chieftain and as a show of gratitude, the current chieftain has given the group a treasure chest! 

Inside, the group found 400gp worth of treasure as well as the Blueprints for a special SpellStriking Rune!

This special rune can be engraved on a weapon to allow our magus to set off a magical explosion when he misses his spell strike.
The damage is not super large, but it is a nice little consolation prize that allows Smoke to deal a little damage even if he
misses his big move.

Another treasure from the lizard people was in the form of a Mentalist Staff. This mind bending staff has the Phantom Pain spell
attached to it. The village mystic had broken the staff long ago and could not fix it herself. 

With the Occult knowledge of Hiru and Gregile, they where able to fix the staff and get it working again. Hiru ended up taking up the staff.

## The Trolls March

Shortly after the Lizard people swore their loyalty to the group, they encountered a similar face: Ekundo!
He has been killing trolls in these parts of the woods and is close to exterminating them entirely.

He asks the party if they would help him with a plot that would rid the woods of trolls. They accept. 

The plan is to go to the trolls main base of operations: an abandoned Dwarf Fortress. Normally, storming the
front door would be a brutal affair, but Ekundo is a clever man! He has observed that the second in command is looking
to overthrow his current warlord. Ekundo seeks to use him and kill him after the other side is defeated.

The group agrees to Ekundo's terms and promises to kill all the trolls, even the ones that helped them, after all the dust
is settled. 

## The Fights!

The group's first fight was with the Wife of the current warlord. She got a Slow spell off on Rox
but was otherwise not much of a threat. 

Next up was a troll and hobgoblin band. There numbers put up more of a challenge for the group, but
they where also dispatched.  

Finally, the group was about to climb up the stairs to take on the Warlord himself, but Gregile ran
into a pair of Harpies! Their song proved to be captivating for Hiru and Smoke, but Rox and Gregile where
able to keep their senses and take out the threats.
