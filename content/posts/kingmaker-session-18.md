The group talks to the leader of the Embeth Travelers, lovingly named, Jimmy! They compete in a hunting
competition. Killing all manner of beast, including a Tyrannosaurus! They also find a suspicious creak that
seems to have an unusually large amount of First World magics tainting it. 

## Dinner on the Roof

The group enjoys a lovely feast on the second floor of the Hunter's Lodge. The Embeth Travelers serve their guests
a full 3 course meal and the group is able to socialize with the 3 groups that they where going to be competing with.

First is the Aldori sisters. These highly trained ladies are looking to make a name for themselves on the battle field.
They see this competition as a chance to do just that. Proving their skills with the blade. The group almost
offended the sisters due to a misplaced remark from Rox. Thankfully, the groups resident ladies man, Stetson is able
to salvage the situation. 

The second is Jimmy himself! He reveals the prizes the groups are competing for and also talks about how it would work.
The groups would have 1 day to kill as many beasts as they can. The group with the most beasts at the end of the day would
be the winners. Jimmy also reveals that he finds it highly unusual for so many large beasts to have been spotted in such a small
area.

The last is a bard from Pitax the group has dubbed Anime! She may be from Pitax but she is not hostile. At least not
physically. She spends most of the feast playing on her lute and did not show any signs about even knowing about the
strange Fey magic that is influencing the wilds. 

## The Hunt is On!

The next day, the groups are taken up the river by the Embeth Travelers and stop at a ruined hut. It has a trail of blood
leading into the forests and a hole in the roof. The sisters and the bard immediately charge ahead of everyone else and
disappear into the wilds. 

The group first decides to follow the blood trail. They encounter a green dragon that is noticeably more green than usual.
The group takes it out without to much issue. Right after, the group is startled by the sound of screams off in the distance.

They make their way through the forest and come across a bowl shaped clearing. They find the Aldori sisters, barely holding on.
One of them was down and the other looked like she would fall any moment. The beast that had beat them stomping through the
trees and charging into the group. A Tyrannosaurus! She was able to eat Rox, but this proved to be a mistake as Rox was able to
cut his way out of the beast and make it a fossil once more.

The group was able to find it's nest. A single egg remaining. Rox took the egg for safe keeping.

With two large beasts under their belts, the group was now looking to see if they could find the location of the suspicious
Pitax bard. They found her overlooking the hunting grounds on a ledge. She was completely unconcerned with the competition and
seemed to only be observing the others. 

The group was not able to get much out of her so they went back to the hunting grounds to secure their lead. They killed some
giant elk and also found a creak that had a large amount of first world magic flowing from it. Going up the river, the group
found an area that was devoid of life. Many of the plants where dead and the taint of the first world was everywhere. Despite
this, one plant remained. A terrifying cluster of vines and mouths attacked the group. The plant proved to be a tough encounter, slicing
its targets to pieces and even devouring our poor gnoll Smith. Thankfully, he was able to cut his way out and kill the monster.

## Conclusion

The group has beaten all the dangers of the hunting grounds and is now going to be enjoying another feast courtesy of the
Travelers. They are the winners of this competition by a landslide and will get their reward.

They also defeated so many foes that they leveled up! Reaching level 7.
