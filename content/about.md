# Welcome to table takers!

A simple site for the purposes of serving as a place for my players to keep track of campaigns and blog about them.

On this site, you can expect to see session reports and lore about the different campaign worlds we play.

I will also try to post and blog about different thing that are on my mind. Mostly having to do with TTRPGs and Game Mastering.
