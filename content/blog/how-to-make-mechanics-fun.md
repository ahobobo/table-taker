In TTRPGs there is a wide variety of play styles. Two seemingly opposed play styles
are those that like mechanics and dice rolls and those that like a more narrative
focus. In this post I am here to say that this seemly stark divide does not actually
exist.

I hope to show more narrative minded players how to have fun in a more mechanical
system. I also hope to show mechanical players how to make dry dice rolls into interesting
story beats.

## Combat

Combat is a large part of most games. However, many players tend to dislike it. This is
usually because combat is seen as a pause in the story. Instead of things happening in
the fiction, the game turns into making a whole lotta dice rolls and math for the next 10
to 60 minuets. 

The start of combat does not entail the stop of the fiction. When exploring or interacting
with NPCs the GM describes the player's surroundings, the players give their actions and the
GM describes how their actions change things. The cycle repeats and the story is moved forward.

In combat the main difference is that the dice, not the GM decide the outcome of each action.
When a player's turn begins in combat, he might decide to move and make an attack. He narrates
his knight charging at the goblin. He raises his sword and ... *rolls dice*... its a hit! He
slashes at the goblin, green blood erupting from his shoulder.

## Sandwiching Mechanics

The above description of the knight charging, swinging and then the player waiting for the dice roll
before describing the outcome of the swing is an example of sandwiching mechanics between narrative.

```
    --- description of wind up ---
    
    --- dice rolls and rules to determine outcome of action ---

    --- description of the outcome ---
```

Doing this allows for the story to keep playing out in everyone's heads as you are fighting. Just
cause initiative has been rolled does not mean that the story has to stop. Having even basic
descriptions of your character raising their weapon or unleashing a flurry of blows keeps the
scene alive in everyone's heads. Add in a few one liners and zingers from each side and you
have a full on action scene that you get to act out at the table.

## Does Not Have to Just Be Combat

Sandwiching mechanics like above can be done for any roll of the dice. For example, Wanda is looking
to sneak past a guard in the cover of night. She ducks behind a bush and waits for him to pass...
*rolls*... she fails the check! The GM describes how the guard notices the glimmer of her eyes in the
bush as he passes. "Hey! Who goes there?" he yells.

## Conclusion

For me, there is something exciting about putting the story in the hands of a dice roll. It adds a
certain air of "legitimacy". I did not just declare my character did that I took a chance and
won.

With that said, I recognize that always playing in character and coming up with good descriptions
can get tiring. Its ok to just let a roll be a roll and move through the scene
quickly. However, even a minimal description like "I swing my sword" or "I summon fire from my hands"
gives a faint image of the action in their heads while still moving things along. 

Ultimately, mechanics don't stop the fiction. They enhance it. Introducing complications and
unexpected outcomes to a scene and surprising all players at the table.
