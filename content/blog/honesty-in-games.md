In this post we are going to be getting into more of how I think about things. I will explain
what I value in these games and how I like playing. 

Basically I think its important for the GM to run a fair and open game. His players should not
be in the dark about game mechanics. The story should flow from the game mechanics. Not the other
way around. Players and game masters should hold themselves accountable to the dice. For a cool video on
this topic, check out [Deficient Master](https://youtu.be/13ypfX61PGA?si=bTE7QMWsO9BPFWsI). 

## TTRPG Stands For...

Table Top Role Playing **Game**. 

Games require that the players be open with each other. Players come together and agree to follow
the rules of the game for the sake of fun. 

In a TTRPG, its my opinion that the Game Master is just another player of the game. He is not
above his players. By playing the game he to has agreed to follow the rules of the game.

Players have to roll in the open so the GM can see and know if they where successful. As a player
of the game, the GM should do the same. Rolling behind a screen is a violation of the rules and
does not feel right to me.

## But What If Things Don't Go To Plan?

One of the excuses for rolling behind a screen is that it gives the GM more control over the
direction of the game. 

This is true. If the players don't see the true results of a roll, then they have to take the
GM's word for it. This allows for the GM to protect his players from getting killed in an
untimely manner. It also gives the GM the power to protect his Bad Guys from the players. Letting
them do their special moves or perform their plot important action without allowing the players to
interfere.

The problem is that doing that isn't fun. The reason these games use dice is because no one knows
what number the dice is going to land on. This injects a surprise factor into the game. The surprise
is part of the fun!

I think a Game Master should be pleasantly surprised when a player's hair brained plan works because
of a good roll on a skill check. On the other side of the coin, players and GM should be shocked
when an easy task is fumbled due to a bad roll.

The consequences of the rolls should be impactful to the story and move the game forward. Good or bad.

Running the game this way makes the game fun for everyone. Players get to know that their actions will
have an impact on the story and that the game has stakes. The game master also gets to have more fun
since he gets to share in the players surprise of how the story unfolds.

## You Don't Need to Fudge For the Story

Some groups will have a pre written story. Game masters plot out a set of encounters and actions for their players
with an end goal in mind for them. These games usually require some dice fudging in order to ensure that
things go according to plan. There are 2 problems here...

### Fudging Dice is Cheating

It's that simple. If a game does not have a rule that allows for a reroll, then doing so arbitrarily
is cheating. The argument can be made that if the group is all ok with it then it is ok. However, this
causes confusion and removes the stakes from the game. It cheapens the experience and makes the game
feel arbitrary. If the roll is always going to be the one we want, then why make the roll in the first
place?

### The Surprise is Gone

If players and GM know whats going to happen, then its like rereading a story you already know. Or rewatching
a movie. This can be fun for movies and stories you really like, but its
