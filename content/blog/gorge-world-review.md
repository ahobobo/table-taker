I have recently concluded a short campaign using the specialty rules system called
[GorgeWorld](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/484482/gorgeworld). Its really a
testament to TTRPGs that such a system even exists considering how niche this type 
of material is. Regardless, it exists, I used it, I liked it, and I hope to talk about
it for a little bit!

## Overview

The system is a very simple attribute based system. You have 4 main attributes: Force
Learning Agility and Beauty. Your FLAB. With a secret 5th attribute known as Glut! Rolls
are done using Fudge Dice (more commonly known as Fate Dice) or D6s. 1-2 are negatives, 3-4
are blanks and 5-6 are successes.

To pass a task, you will roll a number of fudge dice equal to your attribute rating. If you
get a single success, you pass! If not, you dont.

The system also has advantage and disadvantage where you can score a success on a 3-6 on any
die if you have advantage. Or you might have your successes be canceled out by rolls of 1-2
in your dice pool on disadvantage.

Additionally, your characters have feats. Called natural items in this system. They grant you
special abilities based on the type of creature your character is.

## Fat Fur

The system's main claim to fame is that it has a system for accounting for eating and gaining weight.

Characters might start fairly small, but over the course of play can grow to be very large indeed. As
characters grow they acquire more feats and can also be given "strains" or negative features that come
from growing to large to quickly.

## Things That Where Tasty

The system runs quick and the 4 attributes can be used to make quick rulings for anything the characters
might want to do. Players can learn to play in minuets and the final result of a roll does not require any
math since you are just looking to roll a 5-6 on one of your dice.

The system came with a good number of feats that give players a lot of options for
creating the character that they wish to play. Feats could also be homebrewed easy for anything
that the group might feel is missing.

Monsters in the system have simple stat blocks and while the system does not come with a beastiary, it does
have many templates that allow a GM to quickly cook up a goon or even a boss in no time.

The game was made with weight gain and other such shenanigans in mind. Meaning you dont have to homebrew
or finagle with it to make it have a fat fur theme.

The end of the book features several mini settings spanning many genres including fantasy, sci-fi and modern
day urban settings. These mini settings have their own rules modules and items as well.

## Things That Where a Little Bland

Combat could drag a bit. Monsters and player characters are both a little to hardy at their base. The rules system
is also lite, meaning that their isn't to much variance in what a player character or a monster can do on their turn.
Having limited combat options is not a problem in a system but it does become one when monsters take more than a few
rounds to kill. My group quickly house ruled that if an attack was successfully defended, then the attacker would gain
advantage on their next attack. This helped speed up combat significancy and made it much more enjoyable.

This could be my own short coming but, while the system does come with a weight gain and fullness system, it does not
really give to much guidance on how to tie this into the game. Weight gain is given more as a parallel progression system
for characters. It does do a good job of rewarding them for going down this route. It is the only way to acquire new feats
at least as written. However, it still feels a little bit separated from the rest of the game since characters will
be doing most things using their attributes. Their increasing size only really comes into play when they hit certain
breakpoints to gain a feat or when they are stuffed to their limit and knocked out in battle. Its left to the players and
GM to come up with ways to make a character's fatness be relevant to the game from scenario to scenario.

## Conclusion

GorgeWorld is a fantastic little system for running weight gain themed adventures. The base book provides a lot of value
for a GM looking to run a game with this theme. The system is also universal and can be used in different genres allowing
for groups to run long term campaigns or smaller ones in different worlds. 

The game has recently gotten an expansion as well! [GorgeWorld For Two](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/507477/gorgeworld-for-two)
provides solo and co-op rules as well as many random tables to help with adventure creation. It also has dungeon crawling  

If you are looking to run a light hearted game with weigh gain as a theme I highly recommend GorgeWorld. I look forward to any
other expansions that the creator might make for the game. I would personally love to see what adventure modules the creator
might be able to come up with. I will be following GorgeWorld closely to see if one gets made.
