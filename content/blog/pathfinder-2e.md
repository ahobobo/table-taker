Pathfinder 2e is a crunchy, high fantasy role playing system that is similar to DnD but has a more
concrete rule set. The system has a lot of rules for covering almost any scenario, but at the same time is
intuitive enough that most people will be able to understand it after a single session. The system is also technically
free. All the rules can be read online on officially sanctioned sites. Ultimately, its a system
I highly recommend for groups that want to have a limitless set of character options and a rich set of rules and
systems for simulating anything that could happen in a high fantasy adventure. Keep reading to get a more in-depth
overview of this fantastic system!

## My Experience

I have been GMing PF2e for about 2 years now. I ran the entire Abomination Vaults adventure path and am currently as of writing
this post am Gming the Kingmaker adventure path. All of my experience with the system has been online using Foundry VTT and Discord.

## Resolution Mechanic

Pathfinder is a D20 roll high system. The DC is set by the GM with helpful guidelines in the rules for setting this number.
Players that have played DnD or other D20 based systems will feel right at home here. The only thing that might throw players off
is the high proficiency bonus that is added to almost every roll that a character makes. In Pathfinder, you pretty much add
your level to every roll you make. On top of that you also add your proficiency bonus that could go as high as +8 when characters
reach max levels. On top of that, characters can get even more bonuses from spell effects, circumstance and item bonuses. 

These high bonuses will be a turn off for some players. "Mathfinder" is usually thrown around. However, this math can be controlled
by simply adding your level, proficiency bonus and item bonuses together before you make any roll and have this number handy. That way, when you
need to get the total, you only have to add 2 numbers together instead of 3 (spell and circumstance not withstanding).

It is also important to note that bonuses only really get very high at the highest levels of play. Most groups will never play at
these levels and as such will never have to add big numbers together.

Ultimately, playing the system at a table might be a little much for some groups. However, if you play on a good VTT like Foundry you
will not have any issues with the math. Even if you are not on a good VTT there are ways to get around having to do complex math.

## Customization

Groups that love character building, weather it be for optimization or for making interesting characters for role play, will be
VERY happy with Pathfinder. The game gives players a limitless set of options to customize their characters. Many players might
find themselves making multiple characters, not because they need them, but just because its fun to do so! The game also has
great community support with free character creators.

## GM Tools

Pathfinder takes good care of its players with lots of options for character creation, but it also does a good
job in helping GMs make adventures. The GM core book comes with helpful advice for new GMs as well as tips for
how to structure an adventure. 

Additionally, the book comes with tables of stats that a GM can use to create monsters of any level. Allowing a GM
to quickly make custom monsters to fit into their world or improvise a monster when a stat sheet is not readily
available.

The book also comes with subsystems to handle social interactions, chases, growing an organization and some guidelines for
designing your own subsystems to handle anything else in your game that you want to handle in a more "gamey" way instead
of doing free form roleplay or GM fiat.

The only thing that GMs might find a little hard to navigate is what the system calls "exploration mode". This is the mode of
play where players are not in a fight but they are also not in a safe location. The book tries to explain and systematize this
mode of play but does not provide solid procedures for handling it. The result is that most groups might end up ignoring this
part of the game. GMs coming from OSR style systems might find this particularly bothersome. The nice thing about it is that it
is very easy to simply insert OSR exploration procedures into the game. Allowing for GMs to put a time pressure on their players
using the threat of random encounters or they can declare that the group has X number of turns before they run into their next
encounter. 

The system gives GMs the power to design any type of encounter they could imagine. GMs can also rest assured that
these encounters will be well balanced for the group and provide an interesting and fun challenge for their groups.

## Final Thoughts

PF2e is a great system and I am very grateful that it was the first system that I got to GM in. The rules are complete
and cover a wide range of scenarios, guiding the GM on what to do every step of the way.

My group loves that wide range of options that the system gives them. We also enjoy the tactical combat and cool abilities
that players and monsters get to use.

If you are looking for a crunchy system, PF2e is a great option with top of the line VTT support and it all comes at the low
low price of FREE!

Groups that will not enjoy the system are those that prefer less crunch. Groups that wish to run a more low fantasy game
or a game where characters are not super heroes will also not enjoy the game as much.

Pathfinder has provided me and my friends hours of enjoyment and continues to do so. Its my primary system and I highly
recommend that groups give the excellent beginner box a try to see if they end up enjoying the system as much as I do!
